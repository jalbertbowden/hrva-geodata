Summary:   Military category type-3 vehicles are tractors with average contact pressures, tanks with comparatively low contact pressures, and some trailed vehicles with very low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 3.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"ENG - Septic Tank Absorption Fields"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Septic Tank Absorption Fields"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Septic Tank Absorption Fields"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.  

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Septic tank absorption fields are subsurface systems of tile or perforated pipe that distribute effluent from a septic tank into the natural soil.  The centerline depth of the tile is assumed to be 24 inches or deeper.  Only the soil between depths of 24 and 60 inches is considered in making the ratings.  Soil properties and site features considered are those that affect the absorption of the effluent, those that affect the construction and maintenance of the system, and those that may affect public health.

Scope: National

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent.  Septic Tank Absorption Field interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of household effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage to the soil surface, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil properties and qualities that affect the absorption of the effluent are permeability, depth to a seasonal high water table, depth to bedrock, depth to a cemented pan, and susceptibility to flooding.  Stones and boulders and a shallow depth to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan interfere with installation.  Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance.  Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in down-slope areas.  In addition, soil erosion is a hazard where absorption fields are installed in steep soils.
 
Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth less than 4 feet below the distribution lines.  In these soils, the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new; consequently, ground water supplies may be contaminated.
 
Percolation tests are used by some regulatory agencies to evaluate the suitability of a soil for septic tank absorption fields.  These tests should be performed during the season when the water table is highest and the soil is at minimum absorptive capacity.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1. Filtering capacity: The soil horizon with the maximum Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the layer with the maximum Ksat between a depth of 60 to 150cm or to the depth of a cemented restrictive feature.
	
	Property used: KSAT HIGHEST MINIMUM ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER 24 to 60 (Modality - high, low, representative value)

		Not limiting		=< 42.0 micrometers/sec
		
	Null Ksat values are assigned to the Not limiting class.  
	
	2. Flooding: Flooding has the potential to transport agricultural waste off site and pollute surface waters.  Flooding also limits building, recreational, and sanitary facility use and management of these soils.  Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	7. Depth to bedrock: The depth to bedrock restricts the construction, installation, and functioning of septic tank adsorption fields and other site applications.  Shallow soils have limited adsorptive capacity and biologically active zones through with waste materials can percolate.  These soils may pose environmental and health risks when used as filter fields.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	12. Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes.  (added for testing 7/2004)

"VA115"|"URB/REC - Playgrounds"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Playgrounds"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Playgrounds"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Playgrounds are areas used intensively for games, such as baseball and football, and similar activities.  Playgrounds require a nearly level soil that is free of stones and that can withstand heavy foot traffic and still maintain adequate vegetation.  Soils ratings are based on properties that influence the cost of shaping, trafficability, and the growth of vegetation.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing playgrounds and the performance of playgrounds after development.  Slope and stoniness are the main concerns in developing playgrounds.  For good trafficability, the surface of playgrounds should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.

Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock, permeability, and the presence of toxic materials.

---------------------------------------- 
 
Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

Suitability for using the natural surface of the soil component for roads by trucks for the transport of logs and other wood products from the site.

Ratings assess:

* The efficient and safe transport of forest products from the site.

* The landscape in its natural setting.
 
* Frequency and duration of flooding, ponding and depth and duration of water table.

* The use of trucks (1/2-ton to log-transport capability).

* Activities that disturb 100 percent of the soil surface area with rutting, puddling or displacement up to a depth of 18.

Ratings assume:

* Vegetation and debris is cleared from an area sufficient in width for the road before use begins.  

* Using the natural setting of the soil without cut and fill construction.  

* Slopes are less than 20 percent gradient. 

* Use occurs during customary periods of such activity for the local area.

* Roads are generally less than 1 mile in length with up to a 20-foot wide running surface.

Ratings do no assess:

* Non-soil obstacles, e.g., slash.

* Frozen or snow-covered soils.

Rating Classes (Crisp):

* Suited - Little or no restrictions to natural road suitability.

* Moderately Suited - One or more restrictions reduce site suitability.

* Poorly Suited - One or more restrictions generally make the use of the site for a natural road very difficult or unsafe."|09/18/2008 13:16:30|12/22/2008 12:43:02|5|"10866"|"1501194"
"VA115"|"ENG - Lawn, Landscape, Golf Fairway"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Lawn, Landscape, Golf Fairway"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Lawn, Landscape, Golf Fairway"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Soils are rated for their use in establishing and maintaining turf for lawns and golf fairways and ornamental trees and shrubs for residential or commercial landscaping.

Scope: National

Soil interpretations for lawn, landscape, or golf fairways are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.  These ratings are based on the use of soil material at the location that may have some land smoothing.  Irrigation may or may not be needed and is not a criterion in rating.  Traps, trees, roughs, and greens are not considered as part of the golf fairway.

The soil properties and qualities considered in rating soils for lawns, landscaping, and golf fairways include those that affect growth and trafficability after vegetation is established.  The properties that affect plant growth are the content of salt, sodium, or calcium carbonate; sulfidic materials; soil reaction; depth to the water table; depth to bedrock or a cemented pan; and the available water capacity in the upper 40 inches of soil.  The properties that affect trafficability after vegetation is established are flooding, wetness, slope, stoniness, and the amount of clay, sand, or organic matter in the surface layer.

Camp areas are tracts of land used intensively as sites for tents, trailers, campers, and the accompanying activities of outdoor living.  Camp areas require site preparation such as shaping and leveling in the areas used for tents and parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines.  Camp areas are subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing camping areas and the performance of the camping area after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are important.  For tent or remote campsites, the limitations would be less restrictive.

Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or cemented pans are the main concerns in developing camp areas.  However, areas associated with picnic areas may have steep slopes and rough terrain for aesthetic purposes.  For good trafficability, the surface of camp areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, permeability, and presence of toxic materials.  Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous for camp areas because of the danger to life and property.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt is high in organic materials, has low strength, and is hard to reclaim.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of the surface layer if the layer is greater then 25cm thick.
	
	Property used: SURFACE LAYER THICKNESS nssc (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	 > 25cm

---------------------------------------- 
 
Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

The likelihood of death of naturally or artificially propagated tree seedlings, as influenced by soil characteristic, physiographic features and climatic conditions.

Ratings assess:

* The impact of soil, physiographic, and climatic conditions on the survivability of newly established tree seedlings

Ratings assume:

* Site preparation is adequate for the establishment of tree seedlings.

* Artificially propagated tree seedlings are of adequate size and     quality, are adapted to the site, are planted during a time           sufficient to assure initial root growth with respect to moisture and temperature, and proper planting techniques are employed.

* Near normal monthly and yearly climatic conditions.

Ratings do no assess:

* Effects of overstory tree canopy greater than 15 feet in height.

* Effects of adjacent competing plants less than 15 feet in height.

* Effects of seedling pests (rodent, herbivore, insect, etc.).
 
Rating Classes (Crisp):

Low - Seedlings are expected to develop normally and become established.

Moderate - Root development is sufficiently retarded to cause death of some seedlings (up to 1 in 3) and establishment of surviving seedlings is delayed.

High - Seedlings are not expected to survive (at least 2 in 3 die) without special treatment or management."|08/20/2007 14:14:52|12/22/2008 12:43:02|5|"10866"|"1501197"
"VA115"|"DHS - Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-Scale Event"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use for ""Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (about 80 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event is a method of disposing of material that has been rendered unsafe and unusable by the effects of a large-scale disaster, either natural or man-made, affecting tens of counties or parishes.  Many homes and business structures will be ruined, either by smashing or contamination.  

The assumptions are as follows.  This method is to be used to permanently dispose of material that would be hazardous to public health if left exposed in the aftermath of a major flood, fire, earthquake, wind storm, or other severe weather.  Disposal of material involved in a radiological disaster is outside of the scope of this interpretation.  Large animal disposal is addressed in another interpretation.  Time is of the essence in the disposal to avoid air quality and groundwater degradation and disease or the exacerbation of respiratory conditions, particularly with material involved in flooding.  The amount of geotechnical background work at the disposal site may not be as extensive as at a normal landfill, thus the soil criteria are stringent.  A site, such as a large parking lot, is available to field-separate the materials into several classes.  The material to be buried is expected to consist largely of lumber, broken drywall, upholstered furniture, household chemicals, electronic devices, insulation, roofing materials, pressure-treated lumber, mobile homes, and anything else not considered environmentally safe to incinerate or feasible to recycle.  This material is expected to be contaminated with mold, rodent droppings, and sediment.  Some materials retrieved from the structures, such as appliances, are expected to be recycled.  Combustible material, such as fallen trees, limbs, and lumber may be burned near the disaster area, if doing so is safe.  The ash will be disposed of at a licensed landfill.  Inert materials, such as bricks and concrete blocks, are expected to be used as fill in the local area.  Limiting the distance to the disposal site from where the material originates is considered desirable.  Access roads will need to be constructed to get to the site.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill and the area revegetated.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  However, because excavations may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the landfill.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-scale Event site it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the fill.




Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

2.  Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

		  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
		  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
		  Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  
		  
		  
		  
3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	
	Property used: DEPTH TO CEMENTED PAN THICK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 182cm
		Not limiting		=< 182cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	OR

	Property used: DEPTH TO CEMENTED PAN THIN (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
		
AND NOT
	
	Property used: RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		not = noncemented
		Not limiting		    = noncemented
				
	Null hardness is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
4.  Too clayey:  This rule evaluates textures from the thickest layers between 30 and 200 cm.  Textures of cl, sicl, sc, sic, and c are rated as too clayey.  If clay minerology is kaolinitic or the soil is in an aridic moisture regime the clay content is not a restrictive feature.  Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes and is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic. Soil feature considered is the weighted average of clay content between 30 and 200cm or above a restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.
		
	Property used: CLAY PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		>45 percent
		Somewhat limiting	27-45 percent
		Not limiting		<27 percent
			
	Null clay contents are assigned to the Not rated class.
 
	AND

	Property used: TAXONOMIC MINERALOGY CLASS (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		If taxonomic family mineralogy is kaolinitic then
		the soil clayey rating is reduced by multiplying by 0.5.
			
	Null taxonomic mineralogy classes are assigned Not Rated.
	
	
	
5.  Cutbanks cave:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.
	
	
		A. Instability of the cutbank can be caused by the coarseness of the soil material.
		
		Property used: FRAGMENT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
		Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 80 percent by volume
		     Somewhat limiting	60-80 percent by volume
		     Not limiting	Less than 60 percent by volume
		     
		 Property used: SAND PERCENT LESS CLAY IN DEPTH 30-180CM
		 
		 Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 185
		     Somewhat limiting	170-185
		     Not limiting	Less than 170
		     
		  (The clay content is subtracted from the sand content.  100 is added to the difference to keep the numbers positive.  This number is a sort of effective sand content, adjusting for the adhesiveness of clay.)
		     
		     
		 B.  High shrink-swell can cause instability of cutbanks.
		 
		 Property used: LEP 25-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE
		 
		 Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		LEP above 9
		     Somwewhat limiting	LEP 6 to 9
		     Not limiting	LEP less than 6
		     
		     
		  C. Silty material that is not loess can be unstable.
		  
		  Property used: PARENT MATERIAL KIND IS LOESS
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		High silt and not loess
		     Not limiting	High silt and is loess
		     
		  Property used: SILT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		     Somewhat limiting	Greater than 75 percent silt
		     Not limiting	Less than 75 percent silt
		     
		  Silt content is not considered to ever be a severe limitation.
		  
		  
		  
6.  Too Sandy: Sandy soils may slump and are droughty, making establishment of vegetative cover difficult.  Soil feature considered is the sand content, minus clay, of the thickest soil layer between 25 and 200cm or above a cemented restrictive layer.  This rule evaluates the weighted average of sand minus clay between 30 and 180 cm.  Textures of LCOS, LS, LFS, LVFS, COS, S, FS, VFS, and SG are rated as too sandy.
		
	Property used: SAND PERCENT LESS CLAY IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:

		Not limiting		All others
			
	Null sand contents are assigned to the Not rated class.

	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
8.  Depth to saturated zone: Soils with shallow depth to a water table may become waterlogged and boggy during periods of heavy precipitation and are slow to drain.  These soils have the potential to contamination the ground water which may create health and environmental hazards.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 3 dry season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 3 dry season

Summary:  Military category type-3 vehicles are tractors with average contact pressures, tanks with comparatively low contact pressures, and some trailed vehicles with very low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 3.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"DHS - Suitability for Composting Medium and Final Cover"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for composting medium and final cover materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meet some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Composting Medium and Final Cover"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soil's potential as a source of composting medium or final cover.  The soil property contributing the least is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less than a desirable source of composting medium or final cover.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the ""DHS - Composting Medium and Final Cover"" interpretive rule.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:


Generally, the upper part of the soil, which is richest in organic matter, is most desirable for use as medium or cover material; however, material excavated from deeper layers is also used.  In this rating, the upper 100cm of soil material is evaluated for use as topsoil.  In the borrow area, the material below 100cm inches is evaluated for its suitability for plant growth after the upper 100cm is removed.

Scope: National

Soil properties that are used to rate the soil as a composting medium and final cover material are those that affect plant growth; the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading; and the reclamation of the borrow area.

The physical and chemical soil properties and qualities that influence plant growth are the presence of toxic substances, soil reaction, and those properties that are inferred from the soil texture, such as the available water capacity and fertility.  The properties that influence the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading are the amount of rock fragments, slope, depth to the water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material.  The properties that influence the reclamation of the borrow area are the slope, depth to the water table, amount of rock fragments, depth to rock, and the presence of toxic material.  The presence of even a small percentage of rock fragments in excess of 4.7mm is detrimental to the desirability of the compost material produced.

Summary:  Military category type-5 vehicles are most all-wheel-drive trucks, a great number of trailed vehicles, and heavy tanks.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 5.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"AWM - Land Application of Municipal Sewage Sludge"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Land Application of Municipal Sewage Sludge"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Land Application of Municipal Sewage Sludge"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Municipal sewage sludge is the residual product of the treatment of municipal sewage.  The solid component is composed mainly of cell mass, primarily bacteria cells which have developed during secondary treatment and which have incorporated soluble organic into their own bodies.  Sludge also contains small amounts of sand, silt, and other solid debris.

The water content of sludge ranges from about 98 percent to about 40 percent or less.  The sludge is called liquid if it is more than about 90 percent water, slurry if it is about 90 to 50 percent water, and solid if it is less than about 50 percent water.  Depending on the water content, the sludge can be moved by pump, conveyor, or auger.

Municipal sewage sludges have a variable nitrogen content.  Some sludge contains constituents that are toxic to plant growth or hazardous to the food chain (such as heavy metals or exotic organic compounds) and should be chemically analyzed prior to use.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on utilizing the nutrients in the waste for crop production and is not directed toward reclaiming or restoring critical areas or making the most efficient use of moisture.  Applications of slurry sludge can be by tank wagon or by irrigation equipment that is modified as necessary to function properly.  Applications of solid and slurry sludges can be made at the surface or subsurface.

The soil properties and qualities considered in the ratings are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the rate and method of application.  Soil properties and qualities that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, soil reaction, sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density.  They also affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Slope and the susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for water erosion.  Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to the treatment of wastes.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military train and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's surface property has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Helicopter Landing Zones are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used as landing zones.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its present condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.

The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on site preparation and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after landing zones have been constructed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Helicopter Landing Zones are areas that are developed to land helicopters and transport troops and supplies.  Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence construction, maintenance, and readiness of helicopter landing zones.  Dusty surface layer, slope, or the amount of large stones influence the development and functionality of an area for landing helicopters.  Flooding or ponding may restrict the period when the landing zone can be used.

"VA115"|"ENG - Construction Materials; Roadfill"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Roadfill"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soil's potential as a source of roadfill.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then a desirable source of roadfill.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Roadfill"" interpretive rule.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Roadfill consists of soil material that is excavated from its original position and used in road embankments elsewhere.  The evaluations for roadfill are for low embankments that generally are less than 6 feet in height and are less exacting in design than high embankments, such as those along superhighways.  The rating is given for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet, based on the assumption that soil horizons will be mixed in loading, dumping, and spreading.  In Table 620-7 criteria, limits, and restrictive features for rating soils for local roads and streets are given.  Soils are rated as to the amount of material available for excavation, the ease of excavation, and how well the material performs after it is in place.

Scope: National

Soil properties that affect the amount of material available for excavation are thickness of suitable material above bedrock or other material that is not suitable.  The percent of coarse fragments more than 3 inches in diameter, the depth to a seasonal high water table, and the slope are properties that influence the ease of excavation.  How well the soil performs in place is indicated by the AASHTO classification and group index and by the shrink-swell potential.  A high content of gypsum can cause piping or pitting.  Some damage to the borrow area is expected; but if revegetation and erosion control are likely to be difficult, the soil is rated severe.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 6 1-pass wet season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 6 1-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type-6 vehicles are a great number of all-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles intended primarily for highway use.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 6.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"AWM - Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Rapid Infiltration Disposal of Wastewater"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

In this process, the wastewater is applied in a level basin and percolates through the soil.  The treated water eventually reaches the ground water.  Application rates range from 4 to 120 inches per week.

The wastewater considered generally is from municipal wastewater treatment plants.  The nitrogen content generally is low.  Normally, the heavy metal content is low; however, chemical analysis should be made prior to use.  Because the thickness of soil material needed for proper renovation of the wastewater is more than 72 inches, geologic and hydrologic investigations during the planning stages.  This information is needed to ensure proper design and to determine reliability of performance as well as the potential for pollution of the ground water.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment design or process but the basin may be vegetated.

The soil properties and qualities that influence risk of pollution, design and construction, and performance are major considerations.  Depth to a seasonal high water table, flooding, and depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan present potential hazards and influence design and construction.  Slope and stones are also important considerations in design and construction.  The properties and qualities that influence performance are permeability and soil reaction.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater. 

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Cobble content: Excessive cobbles (rock fragments, 3 to 10 inches in size) in the upper 72 inches (180 cm) of the soil can interfere with construction equipment.  Soil feature considered is percent weighted average by weight coarse fragments 3 to 10 inches in size in the upper 72 inches of soil or above a restrictive layer.

		Not limiting		<= 15%
		
	Null 3 to 10 inch rock fragment data are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	2.  Flooding: Flooding at frequency greater then rare has the potential to transport agricultural waste off site and pollute surface waters.  Flooding also limits the recreational use and management of these soils.  Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

	Null frequency is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	3.  Restricted permeability: The soil horizon with the minimum Ksat governs the rate of water movement through the whole soil.  When this rate is low, transmission of fluids into and through the soil is impeded and runoff, infiltration, and percolation of pollutants may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the layer with the minimum saturated hydraulic conductivity above a restrictive layer.
	
	Property used: KSAT MINIMUM ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER (Modality - high, low, representative value)

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 1 dry season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 1 dry season

Summary:  Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight vehicles with low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch).  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 1.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships, which produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.	Slipperiness:  Slipperiness is the condition where the soil has a potential to become slick when used for vehicular traffic.  During the dry season this condition is most common and persistent were the soil is ponded, flooded, or has a high water table.  If these conditions are not present soil may become slippery after precipitation events but the condition is not persistent.

"VA115"|"ENG - Daily Cover for Landfill"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Daily Cover for Landfill"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Daily Cover for Landfill"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Daily cover for landfill is the soil material that is applied daily to compacted solid waste in a sanitary landfill.  The cover material is obtained offsite, transported, and spread on the area.  The required soil characteristics for both daily and final cover materials are similar enough to share one rating.

Scope: National

Soil interpretations for Daily Cover for Landfills are a tool for guiding the user in barrow site selection and has additional application for the reclamation of some quarries, pits, and surface mine operations.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.

Suitability of a soil for use as cover is based on properties that reflect workability and the ease of digging and of moving and spreading the material over the refuse daily during both wet and dry periods.  Soils that are loamy or silty and that are free of stones are better suited than other soils.  Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread, and sandy soils may be subject to soil blowing.  Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material.  It also may affect the final configuration of the borrow area and, thus, runoff, erosion, and reclamation.

The soils selected for daily cover for landfill should also be suitable for growing plants.  They should not contain significant amounts of substances that are toxic to plants, such as a high content of sodium, salts, or lime.  They should be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table so that material can be removed efficiently while leaving a borrow area that can be revegetated.  However, some damage to the borrow area is expected and plant growth may not be optimum.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Too Acid: Soils with low pH restrict plan growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the (pH) of the thickest horizon in the depth range 10"" to 72"" (25-180 cm) or restrictive layer.
	
	Property used: SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER THICKEST LAYER IN DEPTH 25-150cm (Modality - high, low, representative value)
				
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting	 < 3.5
		Not limiting	=> 3.5
			
	Null pH values are assigned to the Not limiting class.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 7 1-pass wet season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 7 1-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type-7 vehicles are rear-wheel-drive vehicles and others that generally are not expected to operate off road, especially in wet soils.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 7.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

---------------------------------------------------

Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

Ratings indicate the hazard or risk of soil loss from off-road and off-trail areas after disturbance activities that expose the soil surface.

Ratings assess:

* Sheet and rill erosion from exposed soil surfaces caused by various silvicultural practices, grazing, mining, fire, firebreaks, etc.

* Activities that disturb the site resulting in 50 to 75 percent bare ground in the affected area
 
* The use of any equipment type or size and uncontrolled grazing by livestock.

Ratings assume:

* 50 to 75% exposed, roughened mineral surface layer

Ratings do not assess:

* Clean tillage and other similar activities that disturb up to nearly 100 percent of the area and change the character of the soil
 
* Histosols.
 
* Individual precipitation or storm events.
 
* The impact of gully erosion.
 
* Sediment production/delivery ratio or streambank or streambed erosion for water courses on the site.  
 
* Ground disturbing activities on the amount of surface or subsurface water runoff.

Rating Classes (Crisp):

* None - There is no erosion hazard associated with this activity.

* Slight - Erosion is unlikely under ordinary climatic conditions.

* Moderate - Some erosion is likely; control measures may be needed.

* Severe - Erosion is very likely; control measures for vegetation re-establishment on bare areas and structural measures are advised.

* Very Severe - Significant erosion is expected; loss of soil productivity and off-site damages are likely; control measures are costly and generally impractical."|05/08/2008 08:13:51|12/22/2008 12:43:02|5|"10866"|"1501212"
"VA115"|"DHS - Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (~79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Trench is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated trench.  The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the trench.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the filled trench area.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered.  To bury adult hogs or sheep, a rule of thumb is to multiply the capacities listed above by five. For broiler chickens (market-ready weight), multiply the capacity by 200. For turkeys (market-ready weight) multiply the capacity by 40 (Ollis, 2002).  

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because trenches may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the trench developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed trench bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the trench.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Trench operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled area.

Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

2.  Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

		  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
		  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
		  Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  
		  


3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

4.  Too clayey:  This rule evaluates textures from the thickest layers between 30 and 200 cm.  Textures of cl, sicl, sc, sic, and c are rated as too clayey.  If clay minerology is kaolinitic or the soil is in an aridic moisture regime the clay content is not a restrictive feature.  Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes and is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic.

		the soil clayey rating is reduced by multiplying by 0.5.
			
	Null taxonomic mineralogy classes are assigned Not Rated.
	
	
	
	Soil Moisture: clayey soils can be difficult to work when they are moist.  The moisture content of unsaturated soil is time dependent as well as spatially variable.  The spatial variation in the soil moisture is described by the taxonomic soil moisture class.

5.  Cutbanks cave:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.

16.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.

Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 2 dry season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 2 dry season

Summary:  Military category type-2 vehicles are engineer and high speed tractors with comparatively wide tracks and low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 2.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.	Slipperiness:  Slipperiness is the condition where the soil has a potential to become slick when used for vehicular traffic.  During the dry season this condition is most common and persistent were the soil is ponded, flooded, or has a high water table.  If these conditions are not present soil may become slippery after precipitation events but the condition is not persistent.

	1.	""HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM"" =< 50cm

* Activities that disturb 100 percent of the soil surface area with rutting, puddling or displacement up to a depth of 18.

* The landscape in its natural setting.

* Frequency and duration of flooding, ponding and depth and duration of water table.

Ratings assume:

* Vegetation and debris is cleared from an area sufficient in size for the  road or landing before use begins.  

Ratings do no assess:

* Non-soil obstacles, e.g., slash.

* Frozen or snow-covered soil.

Rating Classes (Crisp):

* Suited - Little or no restrictions to road or log landing suitability.

* Moderately Suited - One or more restrictions reduce site suitability.

* Poorly suited - One or more restrictions generally make the use of the site for a landing very difficult or unsafe."|09/18/2008 13:16:30|12/22/2008 12:43:02|5|"10866"|"1501215"
"VA115"|"DHS - Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (~79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership index for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated pit.  The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit.  When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

The estimated land area needed to dispose of mature cattle ranges from 1.2 (McDaniel, 1991) to 3.5 (Ollis, 2002) cubic yards.  A single adult bovine is considered equivalent to 5 sheep or 5 hogs (McDaniel, 1991; USDA, 1980).  Lund et al estimate that about 92,000 cubic yards of volume would be needed to dispose of 30,000 head of cattle, assuming a trench depth of 8.5 feet (which is somewhat below the depth of observation for typical soil survey).  This is about seven acres.  Leachate collection should be considered because the putrefaction of one adult bovine is estimated to release 21 gallons of fluid in the first week and a total of about 42 gallons in the first month (Munroe, 2001).  Collection of gases released during the decomposition process should also be considered. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Pit operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

2.  Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

		  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
		  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
		  Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  

3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

4.  Too clayey:  This rule evaluates textures from the thickest layers between 30 and 200 cm.  Textures of cl, sicl, sc, sic, and c are rated as too clayey.  If clay minerology is kaolinitic or the soil is in an aridic moisture regime the clay content is not a restrictive feature.  Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to spread and compact.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes and is only partially restrictive when clay mineralogy is kaolinitic. Soil feature considered is the weighted average of clay content between 30 and 200cm or above a restrictive layer and taxonomic family mineralogy.

	Restriction limits:
		If taxonomic family mineralogy is kaolinitic then
		the soil clayey rating is reduced by multiplying by 0.5.
			
	Null taxonomic mineralogy classes are assigned Not Rated.
	
	
	
	Soil Moisture: clayey soils can be difficult to work when they are moist.  The moisture content of unsaturated soil is time dependent as well as spatially variable.  The spatial variation in the soil moisture is described by the taxonomic soil moisture class.

		Null values are assigned to the limiting class.
		
		
		
5.  Cutbanks cave:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.
	
	
		A. Instability of the cutbank can be caused by the coarseness of the soil material.

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""very rocky"" is returned as a value of .7 and is given the rating of ""Severe Rock Outcrop"".

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.


15.  Salinity: Soils with high salinity have reduced available water capacity, which restrict plan growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the highest salinity (electrical conductivity) for all horizons.
		
	Property used: SALINITY MAXIMUM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		 > 16 mmhos/cm
		Not limiting		<= 16 mmhos/cm			
		
	Null EC is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
16.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.  In areas where seepage is somewhat limiting, a clay liner may be used to lower the transmission rate of the bottom of the pit.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes.

17.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK (Modality - representative value)

		Not limiting		<= 13 			
		
	Null SAR is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
20.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.
		  
		  Property Used: WATER GATHERING SURFACE
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		    Somewhat Limiting		Concave up-down, concave across surfaces
		    Slightly limiting		Concave across, linear or convex up-down
		    Not limiting		All other surface shapes
		    
		  NOTE!!!  The fuzzy number returned by this rule can not exceed 0.5.
		  
Null slope shape is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.



21.  Too acid: Soils with low pH increase metallic ion availability and restricts plant growth and re-establishing vegetation in disturbed area.  Soil feature considered is the minimum (pH) of the soil layers.
	
	Property used: SOIL REACTION 1-1 WATER (Minimum) (Modality - high, low, representative value)
				
	Restriction limits:

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 2 50-passes wet season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 2 50-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type-2 vehicles are engineer and high speed tractors with comparatively wide tracks and low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 2.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a maximum of 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

1.	Slipperiness:  Slipperiness is the condition where the soil has a potential to become slick when used for vehicular traffic.  During the wet season this condition is  common and persistent.

When high topography is defined as:
	1.	""HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM"" > 120cm
	2.	Not ""PONDING DURATION"" = ""long"" or ""very long""

"VA115"|"ENG - Dwellings With Basements"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Dwellings With Basements"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Dwellings With Basements"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Dwellings with basements are single-family houses of three stories or less with basements.  The foundation is assumed to be spread footings of reinforced concrete built on undisturbed soil at a depth of about 7 feet.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for dwellings with basements are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities affecting the capacity of soil to support a load without movement and on those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are presence of a seasonal high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are flooding, a high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and the amount and size of coarse fragments.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 7 dry season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 7 dry season

Summary:  Military category type-7 vehicles are rear-wheel-drive vehicles and others that generally are not expected to operate off road, especially in wet soils.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 7.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"ENG - Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as "" Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the "" Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sanitary landfill (trench) is a method of disposing solid waste by placing refuse in successive layers in an excavated trench.  The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the trench.  When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 5 or 6 feet).  However, because trenches may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the landfill developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed trench bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the landfill.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the trench is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a trench-type landfill operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the fill.

"VA115"|"URB/REC - Picnic Areas"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Picnic Areas"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Picnic Areas"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Picnic areas are natural or landscaped tracts used primarily for preparing meals and eating outdoors.  These areas are subject to heavy foot traffic.  Most vehicular traffic is confined to access roads and parking lots.  Soils ratings are based on properties that influence the development costs of shaping the site, trafficability, and the growth of vegetation after development.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing picnic areas and the performance of the picnic areas after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are important.

Slope and stoniness are the main concerns in developing picnic areas.  For good trafficability, the surface of picnic areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock, permeability, and the presence of toxic materials.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military training and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restrictive soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The ratings are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources. Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less than the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  Bivouac areas are tracts of land used intensively as sites for field operation centers for military activity.  Bivouac areas require such site preparation as shaping and leveling in the areas used for tents and parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines.  Bivouac areas are also subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

The MIL - Bivouac Areas interpretation provides information about the soil limitations for use as a bivouac and identifies those soil properties that influence the ease of developing bivouac areas and the performance of the area after development.  Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use are also important.  For tent or remote camp sites, the limitations would be less restrictive.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan are the main concerns in developing bivouac areas.  For good trafficability, the surface of bivouac area should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, permeability, and large stones.  The limitations of slow permeability and clayey surface texture are not as severe in dry regions of the country; however, silty soils may be more of a problem because they are dusty.  Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, permeability, and presence of toxic materials.  Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous for bivouac areas because of the danger to life and property.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Too clayey: Clayey surface layers are slippery and sticky when wet, are slow to dry, and, when dry, are usually hard.  Timing and techniques that are used in preparing a seedbed and in planting the seeds, mechanical use, and large animal hoof impact are affected.  Hard surfaces affect seedling emergence and survival.  These factors should be considered in selecting alternatives for use and management.

Background:

Strontium-90 and Cesium-137 are radionuclides that can be released into the atmosphere as a result of above-ground nuclear explosions and inadvertent leakage from nuclear facilities, such as powerplants.  The behavior of strontium in the soil system is close to calcium.  Both are divalent metal cations.  Strontium, having a slightly smaller hydrated radius is more tightly held by the exchange complex than calcium.  Cesium acts in a fashion similar to potassium.  Both are monovalent metal cations.  Cesium is held more tightly that potassium, due to a smaller hydrated radius.  The characteristics of the soil upon which the radionuclides fall determines whether or not and to what extent they are available to plants and subsequently to animals.

Cations such as strontium or cesium added to the surface of the soil as fallout can have one of several fates.  

1 - They can be taken up by plants and cycled in the organic matter of the soil.  This is particularly true in acidic forest soils where the pH is below 5.5.  At this level of pH, aluminum solubilizes and can become the dominant cation in many soils, essentially driving basic cations off of the exchange into solution, where either they are absorbed by plant roots or they leach from the soil system. 
2 - They can be tied to the exchange surface and rendered more or less unavailable for plant uptake.  Owing to their small concentrations and generally high affinity for adsorption by the exchange, a soil having a large supply of basic cations and plentiful exchange sites will bind the radionuclides away from absorption by plant roots owing simply to mass action.  
3 - If the soil lacks the exchange capacity or the soil reaction is unfavorable for attenuation, they can be leached below the root zone and eventually into ground water or surface waters.  
4 - If the soil contains carbonates or sulfates, strontium can be tied up in the structures of these compounds.  
5 - Cesium, which is similar in ionic radius and charge to potassium can be absorbed by 2:1 layer silicates.

The bioaccumulation of cesium and strontium is favored by several soil conditions.  Low cation exchange capacity in the upper 30cm of soil causes these ions to be in soil solution rather than absorbed.  Low pH (below 5.5) causes the exchange complex to be largely aluminum saturated, which pushes cesium and strontium into soil solution.  A thick organic surface serves as a reservoir for cesium and strontium, especially for uptake and retention by fungi.  A lack of clay minerals in the soil enhances the extent of plant uptake and bioaccumulation.  When first deposited, particulate to which cesium and strontium are adsorbed can be moved around on the landscape by water and wind.  If calcium carbonate or gypsum are present, strontium can be tightly held in these minerals and not available for uptake. 


Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member, or complete members of the set of soils that are suspected of having a high  Hazard for Radioactive Bioaccumulation of radionuclides in plant material growing on the soil component.  If a soil's properties within 30 cm (~12 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property contributes to the bioaccumulation of radioactive material.  The interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Hazard for Radioactive Bioaccumulation"" interpretive rule.  Minor contributing soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These contributing features could be important factors where the major contributing features are overcome through management, when possible.  Studies from Europe indicate a fairly low mobility in soils, so only the upper 30cm of the profile is considered (Hrachowitz et al, 2005).

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are very low bioaccumulation hazard (rating index = 0), some bioaccumulation hazard (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or high bioaccumulation hazard (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Potential for Radioactive Bioaccumulation is a method of arraying soils based on their hazard for bioaccumulating radionuclides.  This information can be displayed spatially to show the extent and location of areas where bioaccumulation may occur in the event of a leakage of radioactive material.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Criteria Used:


1.  In a soil where little leaching occurs, calcium carbonate or gypsum can accumulate, depending on how dry the soil is.  This subrule rule tests for either calcium carbonate or gypsum.  The lowest fuzzy number is sent to the main rule level.


Subrules used:

NSSC Data:Bioaccumulation carbonate
NSSC Data:Bioaccumulation gypsum
 The lowest fuzzy number result from these two rules is used.

	A.  Calcium carbonate in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable carbonates, the potential for sequestration is high. 


Property used: CALCIUM CARBONATE FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	CCE	0	no sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	0-10	some sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	>10	high degree of sequestering from CaCO3
	
	Null CaCO3 is assigned 0.
	
	
	B.  Calcium sulfate (gypsum) in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable gypsum content, the potential for sequestration is high.


Property used: GYPSUM FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	gypsum	0	no sequestering from gypsum
	gypsum	0-10	some sequestering from gypsum
	gypsum	>10	high degree of sequestering from gypsum
	
	Null gypsum is assigned 0.
	
	
	
2.  Sorption:  This subrule tests the interaction of pH and CEC against the thickness of the organic surface.  These two factors represent the exchange complex of the soil.  The higher of the two fuzzy numbers is sent to the main level rule.


Subrules used:

NSSC Data: Bioaccumulation pH X CEC
NSSC Data: Bioaccumulation Organic Surface


	A.  It is thought that pH and CEC interact in influencing the availability of cesium and strontium in soil solution.  When pH and CEC are both high, then the availability of these ions is decreased.  When pH and CEC are both low, then the availability of these ions is higher.  Also, if one or the other of pH and CEC is lower, then the availability is increased.  In fuzzy systems as well as regression models, interaction of variables is indicated by multiplying them together.


Subrule:  Bioaccumulation pH

Property used:  WTD_AVG PH 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION 

Limits:


	pH 	<5.5	high potential for bioaccumulation   
	pH 	5.5-6.5	moderate potential for bioaccumulation   
	pH 	>6.5	low potential for bioaccumulation.
	
	Null pH is assigned ""Not Rated"".
	
	
Subrule:  Bioaccumulation CEC
	
Property used:  MEQ 0-30cm OR RESTRICTION

Limits:

	milliequivalents of exchange 	=0	no sequestering from exchange  
	milliequivalents of exchange 	>0-10	some sequestering from exchange  
	milliequivalents of exchange 	>10	high degree of sequestering from exchange.
	
	Null CEC is assigned to ""Not Rated"".
	
	
Calculation:

Interaction Term = (Bioaccumulation pH) X (Bioaccumulation CEC)

	B.  The surface organic layer in many soils provides a reservoir for plant available nutrients.  Cesium and strontium act similar to the plant nutrients potassium and calcium and are treated in a similar manner by plants.  It is assumed in this subrule that a thicker layer will retain more strontium and cesium for cyclical reuse by plants.  Any material leaching below the surface is intercepted and incorporated into plant tissue to be returned to the soil when the plant dies.


Property used: THICKNESS OF SURFACE ORGANIC HORIZON

Limits:
	0cm		No bioaccumulation in organic layer
	>0-20cm		Moderate potential of accumulation in organic layer
	>20cm		High potential for accumulation in the organic layer.
	
	Null organic surface is assigned 0.
	
	
	
3.  Surface redistribution:  Concave areas on the landscape tend to accumulate water and material that erodes from adjacent areas.  Strontium and cesium are added to the soil surface as fallout and are thus susceptible to redistribution by erosion, especially when newly deposited on a surface lacking an organic layer.  The general consensus is that very little erosion occurs on soils having an O horizon.  Some soils are more erodible than others, due to their composition, as is related by the K factor.  Slope is a contributor to erosion.

Property used:  EROSION FACTOR SURFACE LAYER, ORGANIC 0.02

Limits:

	=0.02		less likely to erode
	>0.02-<0.64	erosion possible	
	=0.64		highly erodible.
	
Organic layers are assigned a k factor of 0.02.

Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

The hazard or risk of soil loss from unsurfaced roads/trails.  Refer to the National Forestry Manual for soil rating criteria.

Ratings assess:

* The force that natural precipitation events have to dislodge and move soil materials on roads/trails and firebreaks.
 
* Activities on roads and trails that result in bare ground, compaction, and reshaping of the soil surface.

* Use by trucks, skidders, off-road vehicles and other similar equipment.

* The impact on compacted, bare road/trail surface using the representative value for slope gradient of the soil component

Ratings assume:

* Roads and trails are generally linear, continuous, and narrow ranging up to 25 feet in width.

Ratings do not assess:

* Frozen or snow-covered soil.

Rating Classes (Crisp):

* No Erosion Hazard - There is no erosion hazard associated with this activity.

* Slight - Little or no erosion is likely.

* Moderate - Some erosion is likely; occasional maintenance may be needed; simple erosion control measures needed.

* Severe - Significant erosion can be expected; roads require frequent maintenance; costly erosion control measures are needed"|05/08/2008 08:14:24|12/22/2008 12:43:02|5|"10866"|"1501189"
"VA115"|"URB/REC - Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Off-road motorcycle trails are primarily for recreational use.  Trails for other off-road vehicles may have similar criteria.  Little or no preparation is done to the trail, and the surface is not vegetated or surfaced.  Considerable compaction of the soil on the trail is expected.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing off-road motorcycle trails and the performance of off-road motorcycle trails after development.  Erodibility, revegetation, trafficability, and dustiness are the main concerns in developing paths and trails.  For good trafficability, the surface of a path or trail should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Considerations for desirable off-road challenges are not included.

Soil properties considered are stoniness, slope, wetness, texture of the surface layer, and flooding.  Slope affects the soil erodibility.  Large stones affect the configuration of the trail.  Small stones affect trafficability.  Wetness and flooding affect revegetation and frequency of use.  Surface texture affects erodibility, trafficability, revegetation, and probability of dust.

These soil properties and qualities are.

"VA115"|"ENG - Local Roads and Streets"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Local Roads and Streets"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Local Roads and Streets"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Local roads and streets are those roads and streets that have all-weather surfacing (commonly of asphalt or concrete) and that are expected to carry automobile traffic year-round.

Scope: National

The roads and streets consist of
(1) the underlying local soil material, either cut or fill, which is called ""the sub-grade"";
(2)  the base material, which may be lime-stabilized soil, cement-stabilized soil, gravel, or crushed rock;
(3) the actual road surface or street pavement, which is either flexible (asphalt), rigid (concrete), or gravel with binder in it.
They are graded to shed water, and conventional drainage measures are provided.  With the probable exception of the hard surface, roads and streets are built mainly from the soil at hand.

Soil interpretations for local roads and streets are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect local roads and streets are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index and the Unified classification, subsidence, shrink-swell behavior, potential frost action, and depth to the seasonal high water table.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 2 1-pass wet season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 2 1-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type-2 vehicles are engineer and high speed tractors with comparatively wide tracks and low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 2.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"AWM - Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Slow Rate Process Treatment of Wastewater"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

In this process wastewater is applied to the land at a rate normally between 0.5 and 4.0 inches per week.  The primary purpose is wastewater treatment rather than irrigation of crops.  Application rates commonly exceed those needed for supplemental irrigation for crop production.  The applied wastewater is treated as it moves through the soil.  Much of the treated water percolates to the ground water and some enter the atmosphere by evapotranspiration.  Surface runoff of the applied water generally is not allowed.  Water-logging is avoided either through control of the application rate or the use of tile drains, or both.

The wastewater considered includes municipal wastewater and effluent from food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and possibly industrial waste.  It may be, although rarely is, untreated sewage or may be wastewater that has received primary or secondary treatment.  Food-processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it is high in sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluents, as discussed here, refer to the effluents from a facility used to treat or store food-processing wastewater, domestic wastes, or animal wastes.  Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  Lagoons or storage ponds for animal wastes have an effluent that has a much higher concentration of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  The heavy metal content generally is low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment design or process but the basin may be vegetated.  However, it is assumed that crops are grown or may be grown as a part of the soil-plant treatment process.  Checks should be made to ensure that heavy metals and nitrogen are not added in excessive amounts.

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the application of wastes.  Properties and qualities that affect absorption are the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a seasonal high water table, the available water capacity, permeability, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, soil reaction, cation exchange capacity, and slope.  Soil reaction, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Wind erodibility group, erosion factor, slope, and susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for wind erosion and water erosion.  Stones can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Low adsorption: Soils with low CEC to clay ratio have limited potential for sequestering heavy metals and other potential pollutants found in agricultural waste and sustaining vigorous plant growth.

----------------------------------------

Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

* Ratings indicate the suitability of using deep soil tillage equipment.

Ratings assess:

* Activities that include subsoiling, ripping and other subsurface soil disturbance across the slope.

* Activities that treat up to 50 to 75 percent of the site to 36 in depth to break up restrictive or compacted layers and increase infiltration for plant growth.

* Features and characteristics from the surface to 36 in depth.
The use of rippers, subsoilers and other implements pulled by bulldozers (D8 or equivalent) that till at a depth greater than 12.

* Year-round water tables and year-round ponding.

Ratings assume:

* Activities occur during customary periods of such work for the local area.

Ratings do not assess:

* Non-soil obstacles, e.g., slash.

* Human-caused compacted layers from harvesting or other site activities (only natural restrictive layers are considered).

* Frozen or snow-covered soils.

Rating Classes (Crisp):

* Suited - Little or no restrictions to deep mechanical site preparation.

* Poorly Suited - One or more restrictions reduce the effective and safe use of equipment.

* Unsuited - One or more restrictions generally prevent a sufficient level of deep mechanical site preparation."|08/20/2007 14:14:52|12/22/2008 12:43:02|5|"10866"|"1501184"

Summary:  Military category type-7 vehicles are rear-wheel-drive vehicles and others that generally are not expected to operate off road, especially in wet soils.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 7.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"ENG - Dwellings W/O Basements"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Dwellings W/O Basements"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Dwellings W/O Basements"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Dwellings without basements are single-family houses of three stories or less without basements.  The foundation is assumed to be spread footings of reinforced concrete built on undisturbed soil at a depth of 2 feet or at the depth of maximum frost penetration, whichever is deeper.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for dwellings w/o basements are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities affecting the capacity of soil to support a load without movement and on those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties and qualities affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are the presence of a high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are a seasonal high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and the amount and size of rock fragments.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 1 1-pass wet season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 1 1-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight vehicles with low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch).  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 1.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"AWM - Manure and Food Processing Waste"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Manure and Food Processing Waste"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Manure and Food Processing Waste"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Manure is the excrement of livestock and poultry.  The consistency of manure is labile.  It changes in storage or treatment, and it depends upon the bedding used and upon whether the manure is diluted or allowed to dry.  Food processing wastes consist of damaged fruit and vegetables and the peelings, stems, leaves, pits, and soil particles removed in food preparation.  Most wastes produced in the processing of milk, cheese, and meat are liquids.  Paunch manure is an exception.

Manure and food processing wastes have variable nitrogen content.  The material is solid, slurry, or liquid.  A high nitrogen content limits the application rate.  Toxic or otherwise dangerous wastes, such as those mixed with the lye used in food processing, are outside the meaning of manure and food processing wastes as used in this interpretation.

Scope: National

The soil rating guide is based on utilizing the nutrients in the wastes for crop production and is not directed toward reclaiming or restoring critical areas or making the most efficient use of moisture.  Applications of liquid wastes can be made by tank wagon or conventional irrigation methods that are modified as necessary to function properly.  Applications of solid and slurry wastes can be made at the surface or subsurface.

This interpretive rule uses the criteria published in the AGRICULTURAL WASTE MANAGEMENT FIELD HANDBOOK (Part 651), Engineering Division, Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA.

Soil properties and qualities considered are those that affect soil absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, the susceptibility to wind or water erosion, and the rate and method of the application of wastes.  Soil properties that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, sodium adsorption ratio, the depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and the available water capacity.  Soil reaction, sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  The wind erodibility group, erosion factor, slopes, and susceptibility to flooding are used to measure the potential for wind and water erosion. Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of wastes.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to the treatment of wastes.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Low adsorption: Soils with low CEC to clay ratio have limited potential for sequestering heavy metals and other potential pollutants found in agricultural waste and sustaining vigorous plant growth.

"VA115"|"DHS - Suitability for Clay Liner Material"|"suitability"|"Clay Liner for Waste Disposal				

Clay Liner for Waste Disposal is a constructed geologic barrier used to confine and isolate solid and liquid waste in disposal sites where protection of soil, ground water, and surface water is important.  The primary objective of the geologic barrier is to control leachate and gas migration.  Flexible membranes and drainage layers may be used with clay liner for waste disposal.  In some situations, bentonite is added to soils low in clay to achieve the desired hydraulic conductivity.

This interpretation rates potential sites for sources of clay liner material.  The primary assumption for clay liner for waste disposal is that the hydraulic conductivity of soils or geologic materials in the foundation of the waste disposal site is too high and leachate and gases from the buried waste can migrate into the soil, ground water, or surface water.  It is assumed that the source clay liner material would be a minimum of 50 cm thick before it would be feasible to excavate.  The material should be free of large rock fragments, roots, or other debris since it would be difficult to screen such clayey material to separate undesirable components.  Once it is excavated, it would be transported to the waste disposal site and it would be placed directly into the trench.  Water would be added if needed for appropriate compaction.  Bentonite would be added to the clay liner material at this time also, if needed. 

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water through seepage or migration of gases.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property, such as the use of a flexible membrane, drainage layers, or increased thickness of the geologic barrier.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  However, because excavations may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates or migration of gases to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of rough bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in getting an adequate seal at the boundary of the rock and the Clay Liner material that would adequately reduce the potential pollution of underground water.

Soil properties that influence the risk of pollution and the ease of excavation and installation or compaction are major considerations.  Soils that have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in installing the liner.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the clay liner material is dug and placed is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil also determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact.  The Plasticity Index and the mineralogy of the soil help define the consistency of the soil.  

See the Daily Cover for Waste Disposal, Large-scale Event national soil interpretation to determine if suitable soils materials are available for the final cover of the site.  It may be desirable to stockpile the surface soil layer in the Clay Liner borrow area for use in the final blanketing of the fill.

The minimum requirements for the geologic barrier are as follows:

Landfill for hazardous waste - Ksat 10-9 m/sec  thickness  5 m
Landfill for non-hazardous waste - Ksat 10-9 m/sec  thickness  1 m
Landfill for inert waste - Ksat 10-7 m/sec  thickness  1 m
(Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Subtitle B - Ksat 10-7 cm/sec  thickness  2 ft, flexible membrane at least 60 mil (1.5 mm)).
(EPA - 3 ft soil layer) 

Criteria:
1.	Soil shall be free of roots, debris, organic or frozen material.
2.	Soil shall have a maximum clod size of 50 mm (2 in) at the time of compaction.
3.	Soil max. particle size  25 mm
(12.5 mm if flexible membrane is used)*
4.	Soil min. percent passing 4.75 mm sieve  80
5.	Soil min. percent passing 0.075 mm sieve  50
6.	Soil min. liquid limit  35
7.	Soil min. plasticity index  10
8.	Soil max. plasticity index  40

These criteria were determined based on information from the following references:

USDA. Natural Resources Conservation Service. 1997. Agricultural Waste management Field Handbook. Chapter 10. 31 pages.

*In the NASIS database, no size breaks easily equivalent to these sizes are used.  There is no break between 4.76 (number 4 sieve) and 75 mm.  It was thought that basing the rating on the material passing the Number 4 sieve would be too restrictive so the 75 mm size is used to approximate the 25 mm.  As a concession, the amount of >75mm material allowed is kept very low (5 percent).



Criteria Used:


1.  Area reclaim:  Soil reconstruction of areas drastically disturbed, as in obtaining material for a clay liner, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

Flood waters can transport material away from the site and can deposit unwanted material on the site.  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional flooding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value less than 1 and flooding is a limiting feature:

Flooding Frequency	Months
------------------	------
Frequent		>0

6.  Hard to pack:  The amount of soil material passing the number 200 sieve, the liquid limit, and the plasticity index of soil material relates to its compactability.  Optimally, the material used for a clay liner should be readily compacted to a layer having low water transmission capabilities. 


These three soil characteristics are examined.  The least favorable of the three determines the soil's desirability as material for a clay liner.

	1.  Property evaluated: 200 SIEVE 30-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


10.  Rock fragments:  The rock fragment content of a soil influences its usefulness as material for a clay liner.  Rock fragments decrease the compactability and provide planes of weakness for water flow.  Also, they may pucture the plastic liner if one is used.  Optimally, the material used for a clay liner should be free of rock fragments greater than 2.5 cm in diameter.  This rule keys on rock fragments in the 3 to 10 inch range.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 4 dry season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 4 dry season

Summary:  Military category type-4 vehicles are most medium tanks, tractors with high contact pressures, and all-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles with low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 4.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"ENG - Shallow Excavations"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Shallow Excavations"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Shallow Excavations"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Shallow excavations are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet.  They are used for pipelines, sewer lines, telephone and power transmission lines, basements, open ditches, grave sites, etc.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or backhoes.

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for shallow excavations are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging and resistance to sloughing.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made.  Slope influences the ease of using machinery.  Soil texture and depth to water table influence the resistance to sloughing.

Criteria:

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for "" Excavated Ponds (Aquifer-fed)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise ""Excavated Ponds (Aquifer-fed)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

An aquifer-fed excavated pond is a body of water created by excavating a pit or dugout into a ground-water aquifer.  Excluded are ponds that are fed by surface runoff and embankment ponds that impound water 3 feet or more above the original surface.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities that affect aquifer-fed excavated ponds are depth to a permanent water table, permeability of the aquifer, and quality of water as determined by inference from the salinity of the soil.  Large stones are also considered because of their effect on the ease of excavation.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Cutbanks cave: Soils with high water table are suited for aquifer-fed ponds.  However, cutbanks may cave or slump during excavation of the pond reservoir and pose a safety concern when the soil texture is silt or texture group is sandy or texture modifier is sandy or gravelly.  This tendency is true for all soils but to a lesser degree and the interpretive model is designed to give a rating no less then .1 ""Somewhat limiting"".  Extreme care and caution should be used around cutbanks to protect from cave in injury or death.  Cutbanks caving can also reduce the life expectancy of the pond unless practices are applied to limit slumping once the reservoir is filled.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first USDA Texture modifier and class of each layer and the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military train and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources.  Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non- limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 180 cm (72 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified providing the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Excavations for Vehicle Fighting Positions are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used and excavated large vehicle and weapons emplacements.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its present condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.

The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on excavation, site preparation, and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after weapons and vehicles have been placed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site and weapon readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Excavations for Vehicle Fighting Positions are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet.  They are used for troop, vehicle, and weapon protection and support bases.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or backhoes.

Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging, resistance to sloughing, and weapon readiness.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made and can affect weapon readiness.  Slope influences the ease of using machinery.  Soil texture and depth to water table influence the resistance to sloughing.

"VA115"|"ENG - Construction Materials; Reclamation"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Reclamation"" material.  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soils potential as a source of reclamation material.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then a desirable source of reclamation material.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the "" Reclamation"" interpretive rule.  

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Soil reconstruction of areas drastically disturbed, as in surface mining, is the process of replacing layers of soil material or unconsolidated geologic material, or both, in a vertical sequence of such quality and thickness that a favorable medium for plant growth is provided.

Most new state strip mine programs emphasize that the land surface be restored to about its natural configuration or better and that the soil be reconstructed to maintain or improve its suitability for the intended use.  Thus, knowledge of the soil and underlying material is needed to plan proper reconstruction operations of mined land.  This guide for soil reconstruction material evaluates the material as a medium for plant growth.  This guide does not cover areas of quarry, pit, dredge, and older surface mine operations that require an offsite source of soil reconstruction material.

When the soil materials are properly used in reconstruction, a rating of good means that vegetation is relatively easy to establish and maintain, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reconstructed soil has good potential productivity.  Material rated fair can be vegetated and stabilized by modifying one or more properties.  Topdressing with better material or applications of soil amendments may be necessary for satisfactory performance.  Material rated poor has such severe problems that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly.  Topdressing with better material is necessary to establish and maintain vegetation.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of reconstruction material.  The soil interpretation for reconstruction material source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Vegetation is difficult to establish on soils that have high pH.  Many of these soils also have a high sodium adsorption ratio, which indicates potential instability and water transmission problems.  Materials that are extremely acid or have the potential upon oxidation of becoming extremely acid are difficult and expensive to vegetate.  They also contribute to poor water quality, in runoff or in ground water.

The available water capacity also is important in establishing vegetation.  Soils that have a low available water capacity may require irrigation for the establishment of vegetation.

The stability of the soil depends upon its erodibility by water and wind and its strength.  Water erodibility is indicated by the K factor; wind erodibility is rated according to the ""I"" value of the wind erodibility group.  Potential slippage hazard is related to soil texture, and although other factors also contribute, the ratings of soil texture represent one important factor.

The fraction 3-10 inches is a weight percentage of rock fragments in the material used for soil reconstruction.  The amount and size of rock fragments influence the ease of excavation, stockpiling, and respreading and the suitability for the final use of the land.  A certain amount of rock fragments can be tolerated depending upon their size and the intended use of the reclaimed area.  If the size of rock fragments exceeds 10 inches, problems are more severe.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 5 dry season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 5 dry season

Summary:  Military category type-5 vehicles are most all-wheel-drive trucks, a great number of trailed vehicles, and heavy tanks.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 5.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

"VA115"|"AWM - Overland Flow Process Treatment of Wastewater"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for waste management provide a means to use organic wastes and wastewater as productive resources.  Using these resources will result in energy conservation, prevent waste, and minimize problems associated with their disposal.  The planned use of many wastes has proven beneficial to the producer and the user of these by-products.  The characteristics of the soil are important in the application of organic wastes and wastewater to land for fertilization and irrigation.  They are also important considerations if the soil is used as a medium for the treatment and disposal of these wastes.  Favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Overland Flow Process Treatment of Wastewater"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Overland Flow Process Treatment of Wastewater"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

The wastewater considered is from municipal wastewater, food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds.  Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality.  It contains domestic waste and possibly industrial waste.  It may be, although rarely is, raw sewage (untreated), or it may be wastewater that has received primary or secondary treatment.  Food-processing wastewater is the wastewater resulting from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption.  In some places, it is high in sodium and chloride.  Lagoon and storage pond effluents, as discussed here, refer to the effluents from a lagoon or storage pond that is used to treat or store food-processing wastewater, domestic wastes, or animal wastes.  Domestic wastes are very dilute, and the effluent from a facility that treats them commonly is very low in carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter.  The nitrogen content ranges from 10 to 30 mg/l.  Lagoons and storage ponds that treat animal wastes have an effluent that has a much higher concentration of these materials mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as domestic wastes.  The nitrogen content varies considerably but generally is 50 to 2,000 mg/l.  The heavy metal content generally is low; however, chemical analyses should be made prior to use.

In this process, wastewater is applied to the upper reaches of sloped land and allowed to flow across vegetated surfaces that are sometimes called terraces, to runoff collection ditches.  The length of the run generally is 150 to 300 feet.  Application rates range from 2.5 to 16.0 inches per week.  The wastewater leaves solids and nutrients to plants and soil surfaces as it flows downslope in a thin film.  Most of the water reaches the collection ditch, some is lost by evapotranspiration, and a small part percolates to the ground water.

Scope: National

The soil-rating guide is based on the treatment of the wastewater and not utilizing wastewater for irrigating of crops.  However, areas are vegetated because plants are a necessary part of the soil-plant treatment process.  Wastewater generally is applied by sprinkler or surface application methods.

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, and the design and construction of site.  The properties that affect adsorption are soil reaction and the cation exchange capacity.  Soil reaction, salinity, and the sodium adsorption ratio are soil properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity.  Slope, permeability within a depth of about 30 inches, depth to a seasonal high water table, flooding, depth to bedrock or to a cemented pan, and stones are soil properties and qualities that influence design and construction.  Permanently frozen soils are not suited to treating wastewater.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 1 50-passes wet season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 1 50-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight vehicles with low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch).  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 1.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a maximum of 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"ENG - Construction Materials; Topsoil"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a source of ""Topsoil"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soil's potential as a source of topsoil.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then a desirable source of topsoil.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of the soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Topsoil"" interpretive rule.

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

The term ""topsoil"" has several meanings.  As used here, the term describes soil material used to cover an area and improve soil conditions for the establishment and maintenance of adapted vegetation. 

Generally, the upper part of the soil, which is richest in organic matter, is most desirable for use as topsoil; however, material excavated from deeper layers is also used.  In this rating, the upper 40 inches of soil material is evaluated for use as topsoil.  In the borrow area, the material below 40 inches is evaluated for its suitability for plant growth after the upper 40 inches is removed.

Scope: National

Soil properties that are used to rate the soil as topsoil are those that affect plant growth; the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading; and the reclamation of the borrow area.

The physical and chemical soil properties and qualities that influence plant growth are the presence of toxic substances, soil reaction, and those properties that are inferred from the soil texture, such as the available water capacity and fertility.  The properties that influence the ease of excavation, loading, and spreading are the amount of rock fragments, slope, depth to the water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material.  The properties that influence the reclamation of the borrow area are the slope, depth to the water table, amount of rock fragments, depth to rock, and the presence of toxic material.

Summary:  Military category type-6 vehicles are a great number of all-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles intended primarily for highway use.  Soils trafficability during the dry season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 6.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (1) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military train and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources. Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 60 cm (24 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Excavations for Individual Fighting Positions are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used and excavated for individual fighting emplacements.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its natural condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.
 
The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on excavation, site preparation, and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after fighting positions have been placed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site and position readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Excavations for Individual Fighting Positions are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 2 or 3 feet.  They are used for troop.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching tools and shovels.

Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging, resistance to sloughing, and position readiness.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made and can affect position readiness.

"VA115"|"ENG - Construction Materials; Sand Source"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a ""Sand Source"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soils potential as a source of sand.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then desirable source of sand.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Sand Source "" interpretive rule.  

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sand as a construction material is usually defined as particles ranging in size from 0.074 mm (sieve #200) to 4.75 mm (sieve #4) in diameter.  Sand is used in great quantities in many kinds of construction.  Specifications for each purpose vary widely.  The intent of this rating is to show only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity.  The suitability of the sand for specific purposes is not evaluated.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of sand.  The soil interpretation for sand source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The properties used to evaluate the soils as a probable source of sand are the grain size as indicated by the Unified soil classification, the thickness of the sand layer, and the amount of rock fragments in the soil material.  They are listed in Table 620-8.  If the lowest layer of the soil contains sand, the soil is rated as a probable source regardless of thickness.  The assumption is that the sand layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt is high in organic materials and not a good source of construction materials.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of all soil layers.
	
	Property used: NOT UNIFIED (pt, oh, ol) (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		    = pt
		Not limiting		not = pt
		
	Null Unified classes are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
	2.  Depth to permafrost: Permafrost (permanently frozen soil layer) restricts or effects excavation, manipulation, transport, stability, and workability of the soil material.  Soil features considered are restrictive feature depth and where kind is permafrost or USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) is ""cpf"" or USDA TEXTURE MODIFIER is ""pf"".
	
	Property used: DEPTH TO PERMAFROST (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 50cm
		Somewhat limiting 	=> 50 to =< 100cm
		Not limiting		 > 100cm
		
	Null depths are assigned  to the Not limiting class.
OR
		
	Property used: USDA TEXTURE (IN-LIEU-OF) (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

	Null depths are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	3.  Bottom layer: If the bottom layer contains significant amounts of material that passes the #4 sieve and not the #200 sieve, and does not contain rocks or coarse fragments, then the bottom layer is a potential source for sand.  The bottom layer takes precedence over the thickest layer.   There is no layer thickness restriction on the bottom layer.  The following child rules are joined by the AND operator and the one with the lowest index number determine the interpretive result.

Child rules used:

	4.  Thickest layer: If the thickest layer contains significant amounts of material that passes the #4 sieve and does not pass the #200 sieve, and does not contain rocks or coarse fragments, then the thickest layer is a potential source for sand.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 6 50-passes wet season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 6 50-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type-6 vehicles are a great number of all-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles intended primarily for highway use.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 6.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

* Activities that treat up to 50 to 75 percent of the site to 12 in depth. Features and characteristics from the surface to 12 in depth. The use of brush rakes, chisels, disks and other similar types of implements pulled by bulldozers or tractors (D6/D7, 150 h.p. tractor or equivalent).

* Year-round water tables and year-round ponding.

Ratings Assume:

* Activities for such work occur during customary periods for the local area.

Ratings do not assess:

* Non-soil obstacles, e.g., slash.

* Human-caused compacted layers from harvesting or other site activities (only natural restrictive layers are considered).

* Frozen or snow-covered soils.

Ratings:

* Suited - Little or no restrictions to surface mechanical site preparation.

Background:

Strontium-90 and Cesium-137 are radionuclides that can be released into the atmosphere as a result of above-ground nuclear explosions and inadvertent leakage from nuclear facilities, such as powerplants.  The behavior of strontium in the soil system is close to calcium.  Both are divalent metal cations.  Strontium, having a slightly smaller hydrated radius is more tightly held by the exchange complex than calcium.  Cesium acts in a fashion similar to potassium.  Both are monovalent metal cations.  Cesium is held more tightly that potassium, due to a smaller hydrated radius.  The characteristics of the soil upon which the radionuclides fall determines whether or not and to what extent they are available to plants and subsequently to animals.

Cations such as strontium or cesium added to the surface of the soil as fallout can have one of several fates.  

1 - They can be taken up by plants and cycled in the organic matter of the soil.  This is particularly true in acidic forest soils where the pH is below 5.5.  At this level of pH, aluminum solubilizes and can become the dominant cation in many soils, essentially driving basic cations off of the exchange into solution, where either they are absorbed by plant roots or they leach from the soil system. 
2 - They can be tied to the exchange surface and rendered more or less unavailable for plant uptake.  Owing to their small concentrations and generally high affinity for adsorption by the exchange, a soil having a large supply of basic cations and plentiful exchange sites will bind the radionuclides away from absorption by plant roots owing simply to mass action.  
3 - If the soil lacks the exchange capacity or the soil reaction is unfavorable for attenuation, they can be leached below the root zone and eventually into ground water or surface waters.  
4 - If the soil contains carbonates or sulfates, strontium can be tied up in the structures of these compounds.  
5 - Cesium, which is similar in ionic radius and charge to potassium can be absorbed by 2:1 layer silicates.

The sequestration of cesium and strontium is favored by several soil conditions.  High cation exchange capacity in the upper 30cm of soil causes these ions to be absorbed rather than in soil solution.  pH above 5.5 causes the exchange complex to be largely available for basic cations, which allows cesium and strontium to be taken proportionally from soil solution.  A thin organic surface provides less of a reservoir for cesium and strontium.  A preponderance of clay minerals in the soil enhances the extent to which cesium and strontium can be attenuated by the soil.  When first deposited, particulate to which cesium and strontium are adsorbed can be moved around on the landscape by water and wind, so convex land surfaces are less susceptible to accumulation.  If calcium carbonate or gypsum are present, strontium can be tightly held in these minerals and not available for uptake. 


Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member, or complete members of the set of soils that are suspected of having a high  Potential for Radioactive Sequestration of radionuclides in soil constituents, either oragnic or mineral.  If a soil's properties within 30 cm (~12 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property contributes to the sequestration of radioactive material.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Potential for Radioactive Sequestration"" interpretive rule.  Minor contributing soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These contributing features could be important factors where the major contributing features are overcome through management, when possible.  Studies from Europe indicate a fairly low mobility in soils, so only the upper 30cm of the profile is considered (Hrachowitz et al, 2005).

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are very low sequestration potential  (rating index = 0), some sequestration potential (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or high sequestration potential (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Potential for Radioactive Sequestration is a method of arraying soils based on their potential ability to sequester radionuclides.  This information can be displayed spatially to show the extent and location of areas where sequerstration may occur in the event of a leakage of radioactive material.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Criteria used:

1.  Carbonate sequestration:  Calcium carbonate in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable carbonates, the potential for sequestration is high.


Property used: CALCIUM CARBONATE FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	CCE	0	no sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	0-10	some sequestering from CaCO3
	CCE	>10	high degree of sequestering from CaCO3
	
	Null CaCO3 is assigned 0.
	
	
	
2.  The type and amount of clay in the upper 30cm of the soil can affect the sequestration or holding of cesium and strontium.  The pH of the soil affects the suite of cations available in soil solution.  At higher pH, the exchange is dominated by basic cations, which plants take up and use.  In lower pH systems, the exchange is dominated by hydrogen and aluminum, which plants do not absorb.  Thus, the beneficial, in terms of sequestration, effects of the clay content are negated as pH is decreased.  This subrule models the change in sequestration from a higher pH system to a lower pH.

Subrules used:

Sequestration Clay Content, Raw
Bioaccumulation pH

The fuzzy numbers from these subrules are used in the calculation.

Calculation:  Sequestration Clay Content = (Sequestration Clay Content, Raw)-(Bioaccumulation pH)


	A.  The clay content of the upper 30cm of the soil determines in part how available to plants various ions added by eolean additions may be.  In a soil having a large amount of clay, the ability of the soil to tie up ions in the lattice, especially cesium in 2:1 clays, can decrease the plant availability of the added cations from fallout. 


Property used:  WTD_AVG CLAY CONTENT 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION

Limits:


	clay content	0 percent	low potential for sequestration
	clay content	>0-18 percent	moderate potential for sequestration
	clay content	>18 percent	high potential for sequestration.
	
	Null clay content is assigned ""Not Rated"".
	
	
	B.  The pH of the upper 30cm of the soil determines in part the concentrations of various ions in soil solution.  In soils having a high pH, the ions added by eolean additions will comprise a smaller portion of the cations available for plant uptake.  It is assumed that in soils having a higher pH, the base saturation will be higher and so the cesium and strontium will represent a smaller proportion of the available cations in soil solution.  It is also assumed plants will not preferentially adsorb the radioactive constituents.  If the pH is low, the cations from fallout will be taken  up by plants and cycled.    

Property used:  WTD_AVG PH 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION 

Limits:


	pH 	<5.0	low potential for sequestration   
	pH 	5.0-7.0	moderate potential for sequestration   
	pH 	>7.0	high potential for sequestration.
	
	Null pH is assigned ""Not Rated"".
	
	
3.  Calcium sulfate in the soil tightly holds strontium, so if a soil has appreciable gypsum, the potential for sequestration is high.


Property used: GYPSUM FROM 0 to 30cm


Limits:

	gypsum content	0 percent	no sequestering from gypsum 
	gypsum content	0-10 percent	some sequestering from gypsum
	gypsum content	>10 percent	high degree of sequestering from gypsum
	
	Null gypsum content is assigned 0.
	
	
	
4.  Organic surface sequestration:  In a forested environment, particularly on acid, sandy soils, the surface organic horizon comprises the reservoir of available plant nutrients.  Nutrients are cycled, stored, and recycled through the organic mat.  As the subsurface soil becomes more fertile (contains more nutrients) the impact of the organic surface horizon is lessened and the added strontium and cesium can be effectively sequestered.  Soils having both high CEC and high pH are assumed to be fertile and more prone to sequester while soils that have low CEC and low pH are prone to have Sr and Cs more bioavailable.

Properties used:

MEQ 0-30cm OR RESTRICTION

Limits:

	milliequivalents of exchange 	0	no sequestering from exchange  
	milliequivalents of exchange 	0-10	some sequestering from exchange

	Null CEC is assignrd ""Not Rated"".



WTD_AVG PH 0-30cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTION

Limits:

	pH 	<5.5	no sequestering   
	pH 	5.5-6.5	some sequestering   
	pH 	>6.5	high degree of sequestering.
	
	Null pH is assigned ""Not Rated"".



THICKNESS OF SURFACE ORGANIC HORIZON

Limits:
	0 cm		No bioaccumulation in organic layer
	>0-20 cm	moderate potential of accumulation in organic layer
	>20 cm		high potential for accumulation in the organic layer.
	
	Null organic horizon thickness is assigned 0.
	
	
Evaluations used:

MEQ 0-10 in depth 0-30cm
pH 5.5-6.5 in depth 0-30cm
Organic Horizon Thickness.

The fuzzy numbers from these evaluations are used in the calculation.

Calculation:

Sequestration Organic Surface =[(MEQ 0-10 in depth 0-30cm/2)+(pH 5.5-6.5 in depth 0-30cm/2)] - Organic Horizon Thickness



5.  Convex areas on the landscape tend to spread or lose water and material and send it to adjacent areas.  Strontium and cesium are added to the soil surface as fallout and are thus susceptible to redistribution by erosion, especially when newly deposited on a surface lacking an organic layer.  The general consensus is that very little erosion occurs on soils having an O horizon.  Some soils are more erodible than others, due to their composition, as is related by the K factor.  Slope is a contributor to erosion.

Property used:  EROSION FACTOR SURFACE LAYER, ORGANIC 0.02

Limits:

	=0.02		less likely to erode
	>0.02-<0.64	erosion possible	
	=0.64		highly erodible.

			Null slope shape data is assigned 0.
			
			
Property used: SLOPE

Limits:

Calculation:

Sequestration Material Loss Potential = [(Erosion Factor, Organic 0.02/2)+(Susceptibility to Loss/2)]*(Slope for Material Gain 0-100/2)

The fuzzy number from this subrule is subtracted from the highest of the previous four subrules to obtain the final rating."|09/23/2008 13:15:15|12/22/2008 12:43:02|5|"10866"|"1501240"
"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 3 50-passes wet season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 3 50-pass wet season

Summary:   Military category type-3 vehicles are tractors with average contact pressures, tanks with comparatively low contact pressures, and some trailed vehicles with very low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 3.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"ENG - Sanitary Landfill (Area)"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Sanitary Landfill (Area)"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Sanitary Landfill (Area)"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sanitary landfill (area) is a solid-waste disposal practice where successive layers of refuse are placed on the soil surface.  The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is imported from a source away from the site.  A final cover of soil at least 2 feet thick is placed over the completed landfill.   Properties and qualities that influence trafficability and risk of pollution are the important considerations for area sanitary landfills.

Scope: National

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Flooding is a serious problem because of the risk of washouts and pollution downstream and the difficulty of moving trucks in and out of flooded areas.  Permeability of the soil is an important consideration in all but the most arid parts of the country.  If permeability is too rapid or if fractured bedrock or a fractured cemented pan is close to the surface, the risk of contaminating the water supply by leachate is great.  A high water table may also transmit pollutants to the water supply and is likely to restrict truck movement during wet seasons.  

Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading required to maintain roads on sloping soils.  Furthermore, leachate may flow along the soil surface on sloping soils and cause difficult seepage problems in completed fills.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Flooding: Flooding has the potential to transport agricultural waste off site and pollute surface waters.  Flooding also limits building, recreational, and sanitary facility use and management of these soils.  Soil feature considered is maximum flooding frequency classes over 12 months.

"VA115"|"URB/REC - Paths and Trails"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for recreational development are to be used to guide the user in identifying and evaluating the suitability of the soil for specific recreational purposes.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  These ratings do not consider location and accessibility of the area, size and shape of the area, scenic quality, the ability of the soil to support vegetation, access to water or potential sites for water impoundment.  Nor do the ratings consider access to public sewers or the capacity of the soil to support localized sanitary facilities such as septic tank adsorption fields or sanitary landfills.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Paths and Trails "".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Paths and Trails "" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Paths and trails ratings apply to walking, horseback riding, and similar uses that require little or no cutting or filling.  The soils are rated based on the properties and qualities that influence trafficability and erodibility.

Many soil survey areas in sparsely populated parts of the country have soil surveys of lower intensity.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.

Scope: National

Soil properties and qualities considered in rating the degree of limitation are those that influence the ease of developing paths and trails and the performance of paths and trails after development.  Stoniness, wetness, texture of the surface layer, slope, flooding, erodibility, and, in dry regions, dustiness are the main concerns in developing paths and trails.  For good trafficability, the surface of a path or trail should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry.

These soil properties and qualities are.

"VA115"|"FOR - Potential Fire Damage Hazard"|"limitation"|"FOR - POTENTIAL FIRE DAMAGE HAZARD
-------------------------------

Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

The potential hazard of damage to soil nutrient, physical, and biotic characteristics from fire. 

Ratings assess:

* The impact of fires (prescribed or wildfire) of moderate fireline intensity (116-520 btu's/sec/ft) that provide the necessary heat to remove the duff layer and consume soil organic matter in the surface layer. 

Ratings assume:

* Soils with a shallow surface layer lack the capacity to safely absorb the effects of fire.
 
* Steep slopes are more likely to erode if the protective duff layer is removed.

* Soil texture and rock fragment content relate to soil erodibility, vegetative recovery rate, and vegetative productivity.
 
* Medium textured soils, with their greater inherent water holding capacity, aaare more likely to be cooler and provide higher productivty potential
 
*Soils with large volumes of rock fragments transmit heat to a greater depth in a shorter period of time.
 
* Soils with less than 2 percent organic matter are more resistant to sheet and rill erosion and have greater water holding capacity.
 
Ratings do not assess:

* The time of year in which the fire occurs (winter versus summer).
 
* Fuel moisture content or volume.
 
* Whether conditions
 
Rating Classes (Crisp):

*None - No impact to the soil characteristis are expected. 

* Low - Little negative impact to the soil characteristics are expected.

* Moderate - Negative impacts to the soil characteristic may occur.

* High - Negative impact to the soil characteristics are expected."|07/09/2008 10:40:04|12/22/2008 12:43:02|5|"10866"|"1501244"

Background

Composting: The Process of Biological Degradation

Biological degradation of organic materials forms the basis for composting.  This biological process depends on the active metabolism of microorganisms in a suitable micro-environment. The six critical factors for the transformation of organic materials into compost are microorganisms, heat, air, water, carbon, and nitrogen.

The microorganisms that carry out biological degradation for composting often are found in the soil or on the surface of leaves.  These microorganisms thrive in a surface or subsurface microclimate with free circulation of air, free flow of water, and a temperature well above freezing. The microorganisms also require carbon as food for energy and growth, as well as nitrogen for protein and rebuilding cells.

Composting facilities are designed to provide these six critical factors in relative proportions so that the process of biological degradation is sustained.  Deficits in any of the critical factors, or imbalances among them, may result in extremely slow composting or a dormant composting system. Mixing of materials also redistributes heat, air, and water and will speed the process of biological degradation. Large facilities may provide mechanical mixing of the compost materials. Smaller facilities may rely on manual turning of the materials or may add some materials that are too large to compost in order to create channels for air flow through the pile. 

Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) are measures of the soil micro-climate that affects the rate of composting.  Both MAP and MAAT are available from the soil survey database.  Composting is most rapid in warm, moist areas that generally have MAP between 450 and 1250 mm together with MAAT between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius.  The optimal temperature inside the compost pile is 10 to 15.5 degrees Celsius. In colder areas the rate of composting may be increased by insulating the compost pile on all sides with an extra layer of high carbon materials such as hay or newspaper. To avoid extreme cold or rainforest conditions, the composting may be done inside a protected area or a building.  The optimal moisture for composting is field capacity, or freely drained but moist. Moisture may need to be added to the compost pile especially if the organic materials are dry such as chipped lumber. 

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the organic materials is perhaps the hardest part of the process to regulate.  Active compost piles need a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 30:1 (30 units of carbon to 1 unit of nitrogen). Many common materials such as leaves and lumber are high in carbon and require balanced inputs of materials that are high in nitrogen such as coffee grounds or manures and urines.  Often the materials high in nitrogen are less available or more difficult to transport to the composting site. Materials intended for composting may vary in their carbon to nitrogen ratio due to many factors and testing of materials is recommended before large scale operations begin. A few C:N examples are given in table 1.

Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as a ""Site for Composting Facility"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Site for Composting Facility"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Site for composting facility is the site location for placement of a composting facility without the use of a liner or placement on concrete pad. The composting facility is to process raw manure or other raw organic by-products into biologically stable organic material as outlined in the NRCS conservation practice standard ""Composting Facility"" (code 317). 

Scope: National

The bottom elevation of the composting facility shall be above the seasonal high water table and on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Compost facilities should be located outside of floodplains.  However, if site restrictions require location within a floodplain, they shall be protected from inundation or damage from a 25-year flood event, or larger. Locate compost facilities so prevailing winds and landscape elements such as building arrangement, landforms and vegetation minimize odors and protect the visual resource. Direct any contaminated runoff from compost facilities to an appropriate storage or treatment facility for further management.

Suitability of a soil for use as a site for composting should be on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Slope affects the ease of accessing and manipulating the compost material.  It also will affect runoff from the site. If slope is limiting, then consult the ""Site for Composting Facility  Subsurface"" interpretation.


Soil interpretations for locating a site for composting are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.


Criteria used:


1.  Depth to saturated zone: Shallow depth to water table limits the site for use as a composting facility.  Soils that are shallow to water are also difficult to reclaim and revegetate, and contamination from leaching may create health and environmental hazards.

8.  Mean annual precipitation: Localities that have low rainfall are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low rainfall, moisture will need to be added to maintain biological activity in the composting mass.  The site feature considered is mean annual precipitation.

	Property used: PRECIPITATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 400 mm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 400-1200 mm

	Null precipitation is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
	
	
	
9.  Slope:  The slope of the soil surface influences its trafficability for equipment and also can cause erosion hazard if steep.

	Property evaluated: SLOPE (Modality - high, low, and representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Poorly suited		> 8 percent  
		Somewhat suited 	<= 8 to 3 percent
		Well suited		< 3 percent

11.  Mean annual air temperature: Localities that have very low or very high mean annual air temperature are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low mean annual air temperature, the onset of decomposition may be delayed by low biological activity in the composting mass.

Summary:  Military category type-4 vehicles are most medium tanks, tractors with high contact pressures, and all-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles with low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 4.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"ENG - Sewage Lagoons"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as ""Sewage Lagoons"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Sewage Lagoons"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic bacteria decompose the wastes.  Lagoons have a nearly level floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted, relatively impervious soil material.  Relatively impervious soil for the lagoon floor and sides is desirable to minimize seepage and contamination of local ground water.  

Scope: National

Farm and ranch homesteads, outbuildings, and recreational facilities require a means to safely dispose of effluent. Sewage lagoons interpretations are a tool for guiding the user in site selection for safe disposal of liquid effluent.  The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas.  While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or flood water.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Soil permeability is a critical property in evaluating a soil for sewage lagoons.  Most porous soils will eventually seal when being used for a sewage lagoon.  Until they do, however, the hazard of pollution is severe.  Soils that have a permeability rate that exceeds 2 inches per hour generally are too porous for the proper operation of sewage lagoons and may cause contamination.  Fractured bedrock within a depth of 40 inches may create a pollution hazard.  Bedrock and cemented pans create construction problems.

Slope must be gentle enough and the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make smoothing practical so that the lagoon is uniformly deep throughout.

If floodwater overtops the lagoon, it interferes with the functioning of the lagoon and carries away polluting sewage before sufficient decomposition has taken place.  Ordinarily, soils susceptible to flooding have a severe limitation for sewage lagoons.  If floodwater velocities are slow and flooding is rarely deep enough to overtop the lagoon embankment, the susceptibility to flooding does not constitute a severe limitation rating.

Soils that contain a large amount of organic matter are not suitable for the floor of an aerobic lagoon.  The organic matter promotes an anaerobic rather than aerobic environment.

Depth to water table is important if it influences the water level in the lagoon.  If it does, a pollution hazard exists.  Sometimes depth to water table is disregarded if the lagoon floor is of slowly permeable soil material that is at least 4 feet thick.  Soils that contain excess rock fragments greater than 3 inches are undesirable sites because the fragments interfere with the manipulation and compaction needed to prepare the lagoon floor. 

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

"VA115"|"WMS - Embankments, Dikes, and Levees"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Embankments, Dikes, and Levees"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Embankments, Dikes, and Levees"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Embankments, dikes, and levees are raised structures of soil material that are constructed to impound water or protect land against overflow.  They generally are less than 20 feet high, are constructed of ""homogeneous"" soil material (without a core zone), and are compacted to medium density.  Embankments that have zoned construction (core and shell) are not considered.

Soil properties influence development of embankments, dikes, and levees including site selection, structure design, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for embankments, dikes, and levees are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

Ratings are made for the soil that may be source of material for embankment fills.  The rating is given for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet, based on the assumption that soil horizons will be mixed in loading, dumping, and spreading.  The ratings do not indicate the suitability of the undisturbed soil for supporting the embankment.  Soil properties to a depth greater than the embankment height have an effect on the performance and safety of the embankment.  Generally, deeper onsite geologic investigations must be made to determine these important properties.


Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities to act as a natural barrier against seepage into deeper layers, without regard to cutoff trenches or other features that may be installed under the pond embankment.  Excessive slope in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the pond embankment seriously reduces the storage capacity of the reservoir area.  Suitable sites may be difficult to find on slopes steeper than about 10 percent.

Embankments, dikes, and levees require soil material that is resistant to seepage, piping, and erosion and that has favorable compaction characteristics.  Organic soils are not suitable because of high compression, low strength, and unpredictable permeability.  When compacting with tamping rollers (sheepsfoot rollers) or pneumatic rollers, stones over 6 inches in size must be removed; therefore, stony soils are limited for this use.  If a water table is present, the depth of usable material and the trafficability are affected.

The content of sodium and salts affects the capability for plant growth on embankment surfaces.  These properties may also indicate dispersive soils that are highly erosive and susceptible to piping.  Soils that contain gypsum may have piping and uneven settling.

Low-density silts and clays in the supporting foundation generally have excessive settlement and low strength.  Loose soils in arid regions undergo much settlement very rapidly upon becoming saturated as water is impounded.  These soils generally do not provide adequate support for embankments.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Hard to pack: Fine textured soils high in sodium and gypsum content with high plasticity and liquid limits are difficult to compact.  These hard to pact soil are limited for use in building embankments, dikes, and levees.   The interpretive model uses the maximum sodium or gypsum rating index and adds the low compaction index.  This sum is compared to the liquid limit index and the lowest index is applied to the parent rule.

"VA115"|"FOR - Soil Rutting Hazard"|"limitation"|"FOR - SOIL RUTTING HAZARD
-------------------------

Refer to section 537 of the National Forestry Manual for specific soil rating criteria.

Description:

Ratings indicate the hazard or risk of ruts in the uppermost soil surface layers by operation of forest equipment.  Soil displacement and puddling (soil deformation and compaction) may occur simultaneously with rutting.

Ratings assess:

* The operation of equipment on forest sites (3-10 passes) when the soil moisture is near field capacity.

* The use of standard rubber-tired vehicles (non-flotation tires).
 
* Year-long water tables < 12.
* Soil displacement and puddling which may affect aesthetics, groundwater hydrology, and productivity of the site.

Ratings assume:

* Rutting depths usually range from 2 to 24 and depends, in part, on the weight of equipment (including carried or pulled loads) and shape and size of wheels.

* Lack of organic/vegetation surface cover.

* Conditions occurs on soil with slopes and other characteristics that allow use of ground-based equipment.

Ratings do not assess:

* Impacts of rutting on sloping sites that may channel surface water and affect hydrology.

* Frozen soil within 24 of the surface.

Rating Classes (Crisp):

* Slight - Little or no rutting.

* Moderate - Ruts are likely.

* Severe- Ruts readily."|08/20/2007 14:14:52|12/22/2008 12:43:02|5|"10866"|"1501249"
"VA115"|"ENG - Construction Materials; Gravel Source"|"suitability"|"Summary:

Soil survey interpretations for construction materials are made to provide guidance to users in selecting the site of a potential source.  Soils may be selected as potential source materials because they are nearby, are the only source available, or meets some or all of the physical or chemical properties required for the intended application.  In theory, every soil may be used as source materials, but in reality, only a few soils have the profile characteristics that meet the defined criteria and performance requirements when rated for a specific propose.  The use of rating guides can provide the user a means to select potential sites for further evaluation.

Suitability ratings and associated restrictive features are for roadfill, topsoil, sand, gravel, and soil reconstruction material.  The ratings do not consider the quality of the source material because quality depends on how the source material is to be used.  Final site evaluation and selection require an onsite inspection to determine the suitability and quality of the materials for the intended purpose.  Implementation of these interpretations helps minimize the need for excessive random exploratory investigation by pinpointing potential sites.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are suited as a "" Gravel Source"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property contributes to the soils potential as a source of gravel.  The soil property contributing lest is identified as the soil feature making this soil a less then desirable source of gravel.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the minimum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the "" Gravel Source"" interpretive rule.  

Soils are placed into suitability rating classes per their rating indices.  These are poor (rating index = 0), fair (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or good (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Gravel as a construction material is defined as particles ranging in size from 4.76 mm (sieve #4) to 76 mm (3 inches) in diameter.  Gravel is used in great quantities in many kinds of construction.  Specifications for each purpose vary widely.  The intent of this rating is to show only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity.  The suitability of the gravel for specific purposes is not evaluated.

Soil properties influence selection of a site as a potential source of gravel.  The soil interpretation for gravel source is used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability or identifying the soil limitations as a potential source.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a probable source of gravel are grain size as indicated by the Unified soil classification, the thickness of the gravel layer, and the amount of rock fragments in the soil material.  If the lowest layer of the soil contains gravel, the soil is rated as a probable source regardless of thickness.  The assumption is that the gravel layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most suited of the following soil features.

	1.  Bottom layer: If the bottom layer contains significant amounts of material that passes the #4 sieve and not the #200 sieve, and does not contain rocks or coarse fragments, then the bottom layer is a potential source for sand.  The bottom layer takes precedence over the thickest layer.   There is no layer thickness restriction on the bottom layer.

"VA115"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 5 50-passes wet season (DOD)"|"suitability"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh. Type 5 50-pass wet season

Summary:  Military category type-5 vehicles are most all-wheel-drive trucks, a great number of trailed vehicles, and heavy tanks.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 5.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

Background

Composting: The Process of Biological Degradation

Biological degradation of organic materials forms the basis for composting.  This biological process depends on the active metabolism of microorganisms in a suitable micro-environment. The six critical factors for the transformation of organic materials into compost are microorganisms, heat, air, water, carbon, and nitrogen.

The microorganisms that carry out biological degradation for composting often are found in the soil or on the surface of leaves.  These microorganisms thrive in a surface or subsurface microclimate with free circulation of air, free flow of water, and a temperature well above freezing. The microorganisms also require carbon as food for energy and growth, as well as nitrogen for protein and rebuilding cells.

Composting facilities are designed to provide these six critical factors in relative proportions so that the process of biological degradation is sustained.  Deficits in any of the critical factors, or imbalances among them, may result in extremely slow composting or a dormant composting system. Mixing of materials also redistributes heat, air, and water and will speed the process of biological degradation. Large facilities may provide mechanical mixing of the compost materials. Smaller facilities may rely on manual turning of the materials or may add some materials that are too large to compost in order to create channels for air flow through the pile. 

Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) are measures of the soil micro-climate that affects the rate of composting.  Both MAP and MAAT are available from the soil survey database.  Composting is most rapid in warm, moist areas that generally have MAP between 450 and 1250 mm together with MAAT between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius.  The optimal temperature inside the compost pile is 10 to 15.5 degrees Celsius. In colder areas the rate of composting may be increased by insulating the compost pile on all sides with an extra layer of high carbon materials such as hay or newspaper. To avoid extreme cold or rainforest conditions, the composting may be done inside a protected area or a building.  The optimal moisture for composting is field capacity, or freely drained but moist. Moisture may need to be added to the compost pile especially if the organic materials are dry such as chipped lumber. 

The ratio of carbon to nitrogen in the organic materials is perhaps the hardest part of the process to regulate.  Active compost piles need a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about 30:1 (30 units of carbon to 1 unit of nitrogen). Many common materials such as leaves and lumber are high in carbon and require balanced inputs of materials that are high in nitrogen such as coffee grounds or manures and urines.  Often the materials high in nitrogen are less available or more difficult to transport to the composting site. Materials intended for composting may vary in their carbon to nitrogen ratio due to many factors and testing of materials is recommended before large scale operations begin. A few C:N examples are given in table 1.

Publications (with estimated ratios of carbon to nitrogen)

Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for use as a subsurface ""Site for Composting Facility"".  If a soil's property within 200 cm (about 79 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting.  The interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the ""Site for Composting Facility - Subsurface"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Site for subsurface composting facility is the site location for placement of a subsurface composting facility without the use of a liner or placement on concrete pad. The composting facility is to process raw manure or other raw organic by-products into biologically stable organic material as outlined in the NRCS conservation practice standard ""Composting Facility"" (code 317). 

Scope: National

The bottom elevation of the composting facility shall be above the seasonal high water table and on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. Compost facilities should be located outside of floodplains.  However, if site restrictions require location within a floodplain, they shall be protected from inundation or damage from a 25-year flood event, or larger. Locate compost facilities so prevailing winds and landscape elements such as building arrangement, landforms and vegetation minimize odors and protect the visual resource. 

Suitability of a soil for use as a site for composting should be on soils with an acceptable permeability that does not allow materials to contaminate the ground water. On sloping soils, cut perpendicular to the contour to obtain level surface for composting facility. Direct any contaminated runoff from compost facilities to an appropriate storage or treatment facility for further management.

Soil interpretations for locating a site for composting are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.





Criteria used:

1.  Adsorption:  Soils having a low cec or ecec may not attenuate biohazardous material from the decay process.  It is assumed that the upper 25 cm of the site will be stockpiled for use in revegetating the site.  It is also assumed that alternating layers of soil and biological materials will be placed in the excavation.

Soils having low CEC or ECEC are not able to retain some leachates.  A soil is a full member of the set of soils having low adsorption if the CEC or ECEC to clay ratio is below 0.05, a partial member between 0.05 and 0.15, and a nonmember if the cec or ecec to clay ratio is over 0.150.
	
	Property used: CLAY ACTIVITY IN DEPTH 30-200cm (Modality - low, high, representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		Below 0.05 meq/100g
		Somewhat limiting	0.05-0.15 meq/100g
		Not limiting		> 0.15 meq/100g
		
	The fuzzy number is weighted by 0.25, meaning this rule cannot cause the component to be absolutely true that the site is limited for the intended land use.

			
Null clay activity is assigned to the ""Not Rated"" class.

	
2.  Porous bedrock: Limestone bedrock (and other types) may have numerous solution channels that allow contaminants to enter the groundwater quickly and with no renovation.  The porous nature of the bedrock is often reflected by ""karst"" phases of map units.  Deeper soils will tend to lessen the risk of contamination.

		  Evaluation used: BEDROCK IS LIMESTONE

		  
		  Property used: LIMESTONE RESIDUUM TEST, NULL SENDS NO
		  
		  Restrictive Limits:
		    Limiting		If the bedrock is limestone, the site is limited by the bedrock type.
		    Not limiting	If the bedrock is not limestone, the site is not limited by the bedrock type.
		    
		    
		  NOTE!!!  As the property is now written, if bedrock is not populated, a N0 is returned.
		  NOTE!!!  This base rule will be expanded to evaluate more types of bedrock.
		  


3.  Depth to thick/thin cemented pan: Depth to thick or thin cemented pan may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when potentially hazardous materials are buried in the soil.   Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer more then 46cm thick where restrictive kind is ""fragipan"", ""duripan"", ""petrocalcic"", ""ortstein"", or ""petrogypsic"" and restrictive feature hardness is not noncemented. If pan thickness is < 46cm then the rating is reduced by half.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

	
	Property used: DEPTH TO CEMENTED PAN THICK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 182cm

	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	OR

	Property used: DEPTH TO CEMENTED PAN THIN (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 > 182cm

	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
		
AND NOT
	
	Property used: RESTRICTIVE FEATURE HARDNESS (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		not = noncemented
		Not limiting		    = noncemented
				
	Null hardness is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
		  
		  
4.  Cutbanks cave:  Under certain circumstances, the sides of an excavation may collapse.  This can be hazardous to anyone in the trench or near the edge at the time of failure.  The sloughed material may need to be removed from the trench, increasing the time needed to excavate.  The sides of the trench may need to be made to reflect the angle of repose of the material or be shored.
	
	
		A. Instability of the cutbank can be caused by the coarseness of the soil material.
		
		Property used: FRAGMENT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
		Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 80 percent by volume

		     Not limiting	Less than 60 percent by volume
		     
		 Property used: SAND PERCENT LESS CLAY IN DEPTH 30-180CM
		 
		 Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		Above 185
		     Somewhat limiting	170-185
		     Not limiting	Less than 170
		     
		  (The clay content is subtracted from the sand content.  100 is added to the difference to keep the numbers positive.  This number is a sort of effective sand content, adjusting for the adhesiveness of clay.)
		     
		     
		 B.  High shrink-swell can cause instability of cutbanks.
		 
		 Property used: LEP 25-200cm OR ABOVE RESTRICTIVE LAYER WTD_AVE
		 
		 Restrictive limits:
		     Limiting		LEP above 9

		     Not limiting	High silt and is loess
		     
		  Property used: SILT PERCENT IN DEPTH 30-200CM
		  
		  Restrictive limits:
		     Somewhat limiting	Greater than 75 percent silt
		     Not limiting	Less than 75 percent silt
		     
		  Silt content is not considered to ever be a severe limitation.
		  
		  


5.  Depth to saturated zone: Shallow depth to water table limits the site for use as a composting facility.  Soils that are shallow to water are also difficult to reclaim and revegetate, and contamination from leaching may create health and environmental hazards.  Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first layer where soil moisture layer status is wet or saturated during any month.

	Property used: HIGH WATER TABLE DEPTH MINIMUM (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:

		Not limiting		 > 200 cm
		
	Null depth to saturation is assigned to the Not limiting class.

Flooding Frequency	Months
------------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2
	



7.  Surface rock fragments:  Soils that have large fragments on the surface have reduced trafficability.  The large rock fragments on the surface must be removed.  Rock fragment coverage criteria are as follows.

		Well suited		 < 3 percent
		
	Null surface fragment coverage is assigned to the Well suited class.

		  

8.  Content of organic matter: Soil in Unified class pt, ol, or oh is high in organic materials, has low strength, and is hard to reclaim.  Soil feature considered is the rv or first Unified class of the thickest soil layer above a restrictive layer and between 30 and 200cm.
	
	Property used: UNIFIED THICKEST LAYER 30-200cm (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting	= pt, ol, or oh
		Not limiting	not = pt, ol, or oh

		Not limiting	not = ""pf""
		
	Null USDA Texture Modifier are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	


10.  Ponding:  If the number of months a soil component has frequent or occasional ponding falls within the following parameters then the rule returns a value greater than 0 and ponding is a limiting feature:

Ponding Frequency	Months
-----------------	------
Frequent		>0
Occasional		>2


11.  Precipitation:  Mean annual precipitation: Localities that have low rainfall are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low rainfall, moisture will need to be added to maintain biological activity in the composting mass.  The site feature considered is mean annual precipitation.

	Property used: PRECIPITATION (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 400 mm
		Somewhat limiting	=> 400-1200 mm
		Not limiting		 > 1200 mm
		
	Null precipitation is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.
	
	
	
12.  Large stone impede the workability of the soil and restrict trafficability of heavy machinery and site reclamation. Soil feature considered is the weighted average percentage of rock fragments of size greater than 75mm in the horizons above a restrictive feature or from 0 to 200 cm deep.

            Property used: FRAGMENTS > 75mm Wt. Ave. 0-200cm (Modality - high, low, representative value)

            Restrictive limits:
                    Limiting                	=> 50%
                    Somewhat limiting        	> 25% to < 50%
                    Not limiting            	=< 25%

            Null fragment data are assigned Not rated. 	
	


	
13.  Rock Outcrop:  Areas that have rock outcrop in the vicinity are not likely to have a sufficiently large area of soil for the facility.  Rock outcrops can interfere with renovation of the leachate from the facility.
        
        Property used: PA ROCK OUTCROP 2(Modality - representative value)
        
        Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" occurs in the map unit name.
		Not limiting		The phase ""rock outcrop"" does not occur in the map unit name.
		
		
Any soil with a portion or full map unit name of Rock Outcrop is returned as a value of 1 and is given the rating of Rock Outcrop and is considered a limitation.

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""rocky"" is returned as a value of .3 and is given the rating of ""Slight Rock Outcrop"".

Any soil with a portion of the map unit name listed as ""very rocky"" is returned as a value of .7 and is given the rating of ""Severe Rock Outcrop"".

All map units have a name, no null data should be encountered.



14.  Seepage:  The soil's bottom layer Ksat governs the leaching and seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids through the soil and underlying materials is unimpeded and leaching and seepage may become environmental, health, and performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the Ksat of the bottom layer or the layer immediately above bedrock.  This condition is not restrictive for soil in Aridic moisture regimes.  
	
	Property used: KSAT BOTTOM HORIZON (Modality - high, low, representative value)
			
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting 	 	 => 14.0 micrometers/sec
		Not limiting		  < 14.0 micrometers/sec
		
	Null Ksat values are assigned to the Not rated class.
	
6/15/04 PRF modified the hedge from ""NULL NOT RATED"" to ""NOT NULL AND"".  The Null values were throwing out a ""Not Rated"" that affected the final rating.



15.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits the soil's adsorptive capacity and the thickness of the biologically active zone through with waste materials can percolate.  Shallow soils may pose environmental and health risks when agricultural and municipal waste materials are applied. These soils may pose construction limitations or environmental and health risks when trench landfills are installed. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table. 

	Property used: DEPTH TO BEDROCK (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 < 200cm
		Not limiting		=> 200cm
		
	Null depth is assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	
	
16.  Slope: Steep slopes impede trafficability of heavy machinery and reclamation of borrow sites.  Soil feature considered is the component slope.
		
	Property used: SLOPE (Modality - low, high, representative value)
		
	Restriction limits:
		Limiting		> 15%
		Somewhat limiting	>= 8 and <= 15%
		Not limiting		< 8%			
		
	Null Slope is assigned Not rated.
	
	
	
	
17.  Mean annual air temperature: Localities that have very low or very high mean annual air temperature are limited for use as composting facilities.  In places that have low mean annual air temperature, the onset of decomposition may be delayed by low biological activity in the composting mass.  The additional expense of covering or insulating the composting mass may be incurred.  In very warm areas, adding extra water and more frequent turning of the mass adds to the cost of composting.  The site feature considered is mean annual air temperature.

	Property used: MEAN ANNUAL AIR TEMPERATURE (Modality - representative value)
	
	Restrictive limits:
		Limiting		 <= 8 and >30 degrees C 
		Somewhat limiting	 8 to <=10 and 22 to <=30 degrees C
		Not limiting		 >10 to <=22 degrees C
		
	Null mean annual air temperature is assigned to the ""Not rated"" class.	
	
	
18.  Water Gathering Surface: Some surfaces are shaped so as to gather water.  This additional water may cause problems for land use.  Soils that are concave up and down their slope and concave across their slope are most strongly water gathering.  Soils that are concave across their slope and linear or convex up and down their slopes are less water collecting.  Soils that are linear across their slopes and concave up and down their slopes are somewhat water collecting.  Soils that are convex up and down their slopes and convex across their slopes are the least water gathering.

Water gathering (concave) surfaces can concentrate water flow and cause accelerated erosion.  Increased costs because of materials and land shaping may be needed to prevent erosion.

Summary:  Military category type-4 vehicles are most medium tanks, tractors with high contact pressures, and all-wheel-drive trucks and trailed vehicles with low contact pressures.  Soils trafficability during the wet season is the capacity of soils to support vehicles in category type 4.  Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data such as topography and soil data and weather conditions.  The Military Trafficability interpretations are base on procedures and criteria contained Army Field Manual - 5-430-00-1; Chapter Seven and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning.  Commanders and engineers must be cautious as the interpreted results can vary greatly.

The trafficability of fine-grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine-grained material to behave like fine-grained soils when wet is more difficult to assess than trafficability in coarse-grained soils (clean sands).  Relationships that describe the soil-vehicle interactions are based on soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large surface stones, and slope are the basis for soil trafficability interpretations.

Rating classes ""Excellent,"" ""Good"", ""Fair"", or ""Poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic and considers soil features that affect trafficability.  An ""Excellent"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that do not limit trafficability and have very low maintenance.  A ""Good"" rating indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use.  Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  A ""Fair"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management.  Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.  A ""Poor"" rating indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use.  Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management.  Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Scope:  The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or man-made obstacles (such as forests or ditches) nor information on vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning).  These interpretations are developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subjected to freeze-thaw cycles, if they are not frozen at the time of traffic.

Trafficability performances were estimated for one vehicle pass.  Today most relations are used for one pass and the combined effects on vehicle performance of terrain features such as soil, vegetation, and slope can only accurately be determined using the computerized Army mobility prediction system contained in the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM).  The engineering relationships that produce vehicle speed predictions or GO/NO GO performance based on measured terrain and vehicle characteristics are contained in the NRMM.

Description:  Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and unified class are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability.  For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under repeated traffic, and not be dusty when dry.  Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are unified class and their relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

"VA115"|"ENG - Small Commercial Buildings"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Small Commercial Buildings"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Small Commercial Buildings"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

Small commercial buildings are those buildings that are less than three stories without basements.  The foundation is assumed to be spread footings of reinforced concrete at a depth of 2 feet or at the depth of maximum frost penetration, whichever is deeper. 

Scope: National

Soil properties influence the development of building and construction sites, including the selection of the site, the design of the structure, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for small commercial buildings are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities affecting the capacity of the soil to support a load without movement and those that affect excavation and construction costs.  The properties and qualities affecting load-supporting capacity without movement are presence of a high water table, flooding, and the shrink-swell behavior and compressibility of the soils.  Compressibility is inferred from the Unified classification.  Properties influencing the ease and amount of excavation are flooding, a high water table, slope, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount and size of coarse fragments.

"VA115"|"WMS - Pond Reservoir Area"|"limitation"|"Summary:

Soil interpretations for various water management practices are developed for use in evaluating the potential of the soil for various water management practices.  These practices may involve the movement of water to or from a site, holding water on a site, or securing a water source.  The soil survey interpretation rating guides are applicable to both heavily and sparsely populated areas, depending upon the objectives of the user.  The ratings are for soils in their present condition and do not consider present land use.  Soil limitation ratings and associated restrictive features are given for ponds and reservoir areas; embankments, dikes, and levees; and excavated ponds.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""WMS - Pond Reservoir Area"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Off-Road Motorcycle Trails"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).

Description:

A pond reservoir area is an area that holds water behind a dam or embankment.  Livestock or wildlife watering facilities are examples of the potential application of pond reservoir areas.

Soil properties influence development of pond reservoir areas including site selection, structure design, construction, performance, and after construction maintenance.  The soil interpretations for pond reservoir areas are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Scope: National

The soils best suited to this use have a low seepage potential, which is determined by permeability and depth to fractured or permeable bedrock, to a cemented pan, or to other permeable material.

Ratings are based on soil properties and qualities to act as a natural barrier against seepage into deeper layers, without regard to cutoff trenches or other features that may be installed under the pond embankment.  Excessive slope in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the pond embankment seriously reduces the storage capacity of the reservoir area.  Suitable sites may be difficult to find on slopes steeper than about 10 percent.

Criteria:

The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Seepage:  The soil horizon with the maximum Ksat governs the seepage potential of the soil.   When this rate is high, transmission of fluids into and through the soil is unimpeded and seepage may become a performance concern.  Soil feature considered is the layer with the maximum Ksat between a depth of 50 to 180 cm.

		Somewhat Limiting 	=> 1.0 and <= 14.0 micrometers/sec
		Not limiting		 < 1.0 micrometers/sec
		
	Null Ksat values are assigned to the Not limiting class.
	
	2.  Depth to bedrock: Shallow depth to bedrock limits site preparation, reservoir depth, and pond maintenance. Soil feature considered is the top depth of the first restrictive layer where restrictive type is ""bedrock (lithic)"" or ""bedrock (paralithic)."" Paralithic bedrock has less limitation then lithic and the rating is reduced by a power of 3.  Depth to restrictive feature must be synchronized with the depth to the restrictive feature horizon shown in the horizon table.

Summary: Military interpretations provide a tool for managing the impact of military train and support activities on soil and soil landscape.  Soils vary in their capacity to support these activities and the ratings reflect limitations that individual soils may have.  Restricting soil features guide the user in predicting how the soil will respond to management.  The rating are for the soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use, existing vegetation, or water sources. Site evaluation and planning, however, should consider these items.

The degree of limitation is express as a numeric index between 0 (non-limiting condition) and 1.0 (limiting condition).  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a degree of limitation greater then zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum degree of limitation of each soil interpretive property that comprises the interpretive rule.  Lesser restrictive soil features are those that have a degree of limitation less then the maximum and are identified to provide the user with additional information about the soil's capability to support the interpretation.  These lesser restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through practice design and application modifications.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their degree of limitation.  These are not limited (degree of limitation = 0), somewhat limited (degree of limitation > 0 and < 1.0), or very limited (degree of limitation = 1.0).  

Scope:  The soil interpretations for Excavations for Crew-Served Weapon Fighting Positions are designed to be used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for sites to be used and excavated weapon emplacements.  As part of the interpretation process, the rating applies to each soil in its present condition and does not consider present land use.  The limitation rating provided is based on the influence of existing soil properties for that use.
 
The soil feature(s) is identified for its affects on excavation, site preparation, and ease of maintenance.  These soil feature(s) also determines the performance to be expected after weapons have been placed and the kind and degree of future maintenance required to maintain the site and weapon readiness.  Minor soil features are not identified or considered as part of the initial rating process but could be important factors where the major soil feature restrictions are overcome through design application.  Use of the soil interpretation rating guides in the planning and evaluation process allows the user to identify and recommend site selection and to plan alternative measures that minimize impacts on the soil resource.

Description:  Excavations for Crew-Served Weapon Fighting Positions are trenches or holes dug in the soil to a maximum depth of 5 or 6 feet.  They are used for troop and weapon protection and support bases.  The excavations are most commonly made by trenching machines or backhoes.

Soil properties and qualities, limits, and restrictive features used in rating are based on the soil properties that influence ease of digging, resistance to sloughing, and weapon readiness.  Depth to bedrock or cemented pan, hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, and the amount of large stones influence the ease of digging, filling, and compacting.  Depth to the seasonal high water table and flooding may restrict the period when excavations can be made and can affect weapon readiness.  Slope influences the ease of using machinery.  Soil texture and depth to water table influence the resistance to sloughing.

CRITERIA: The interpretive rating is the most limiting of the following restrictive features.

	1.  Too clayey: Clayey soils may become sticky when wet and are difficult to compact.  Soil feature considered is the maximum percent clay between 0 and 120cm.

Extreme care and caution should be used around cutbanks to protect from cave in injury or death.
