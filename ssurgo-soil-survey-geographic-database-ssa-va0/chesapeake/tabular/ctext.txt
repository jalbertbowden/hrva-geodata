The parent material consists of sandy alluvium and/or loamy alluvium and/or sandy marine deposits and/or loamy marine deposits. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches is moderate.  Shrink-swell potential is low. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 6 inches during January, February, December. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 2 percent.  Nonirrigated land capability classification is 3w.  This soil meets hydric criteria."|"6035359"|"3875001"
