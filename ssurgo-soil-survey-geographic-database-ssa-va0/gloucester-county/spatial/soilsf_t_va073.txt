"VA073"|4|"BPI"|"Borrow pit"|"A open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed, usually for road construction.  Typically 0.5 to 5 acres."|"157863"
"VA073"|4|"CLA"|"Clay spot"|"Surface texture is silty clay or clay.  Typically 0.5 to 5 acres."|"157864"
"VA073"|4|"ERO"|"Severely eroded spot"|"An area where on the average 75 percent or more of the original surface layer has been lost from accelerated erosion.  Typically 0.5 to 5 acres."|"157865"
"VA073"|4|"ESO"|"Escarpment, other"|"A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff generally produced by erosion, but can be produced by faulting breaking the continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces.  Exposed nonbedrock material is nonsoil or very shallow, poorly developed soil."|"157866"
